       "My husband is an only child and I just have the one sister. With all of this coronavirus hoopla I thought it would be best to try to square away our will. My dad passed away and it's just my mom. My husband's parents are a bit older and not in the best of health to care for a child.\\n\\nI've gotten closer to my sister in the past few years as growing up we were too far apart in age.\\n\\nI thought she would be the perfect candidate for a guardian as she seems to adore my son and my husband gets along with her as well. We have life insurance and had plans for the rest of our assets.\\n\\nWhen we asked her to be the guardian we told her that the only caveat would be if we are ok with her future husband. (I would tell her first and foremost if I thought he was abusive or not good for her, this wasn't about if we could all go vacationing or something). She was immediately ecstatic and said yes, and we were glad.\\n\\nShe called a few days ago stating that she wasn't ready for a commitment and she wouldn't be comfortable being a guardian until she was more settled. I said thanks for letting me know and said I had to get off the phone.\\n\\nI'm pretty bummed. Had the roles been reversed my husband and I would have gladly said yes. If I had any fears / reservations I am confident that I would have asked questions and would have done whatever I could to take in her hypothetical kids. I've always looked out for her and tried to help when I can when it comes to education, career, etc. \\n\\nWhile I'm glad she told me before any legal paperwork got started, I'm really sad that my son wouldn't necessarily stay within the family. I'm just really sad and disappointed and this definitely makes me feel different about my sister.\\n\\nAm I justified in feeling this way, and how do I make sure this doesn't affect mine (and even my husband's) relationship with her moving forward?\\n\\nTL;DR sister said she doesn't want to be my son's guardian in the event of mine and my husband's death. This makes me feel very sad and disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2\n",
       "I’m (17M) talking to a girl (17f) that I met on Snapchat, and we haven’t met yet because of the quarantine. Thing is, is that she always wants to talk over text with me (and I really do to), but it’s been getting real hard to come up with conversation since I’m not allowed to leave the house and everyday is the same. The quarantine has been draining my motivation to do anything and it’s been hard to keep up at her pace. She’s always calling me “dry” when I’m not saying anything. It’s all making me feel like the bad guy and I don’t want to be. Any advice?\\n\\nTL;DR: Quarantine demotivating me from texting girl, and she doesn’t like it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2\n",
       "I have explained multiple times to my partner of 7 years that having sexing 8 times per year makes me feel worthless, unsatisfied and depressed.

       "We have a large age gap, but that doesn't bother me. Nor does it bother him. We have a lot in common and bonded very quickly. He travels a lot for work, but has brought me with him several times while traveling. \\n\\nFor the first 6 months things were going well, but I noticed him start to be jealous of any other man in my life, even co-workers. This was kind of annoying but we worked through it because I am willing to understand.\\n We decide to travel across the country, where he has a friend who lives there. The friend (40 M) and his wife (40 F) are very friendly. My boyfriend begins to have jealous feelings when I am conversing with his friend. Fast forward a couple of days and we are running with said friend. \\nMy boyfriend takes off really fast on a steep uphill, at the beginning of the run and I, being playful, think he is trying to play a joke or maybe impress me. He stops at the stop to catch his breath and I take the inside line and pass him. This knocks him off balance and he injures his knee. (his knee was already hurting prior to this, I just thought he was feeling fine based off of how he took off running). He injures himself and injures his pride a little too. \\n\\nFor the next 6 months, our relationship is extremely rocky. He is jealous of every other guy I speak to, blames me for injuring him on purpose and having a crush on the friend. We had travels planned to another country where he spoke the language and I didn't. He said he felt like a tour guide and stopped speaking in English to me. He was extremely stressed out and clearly not his best self. \\n\\nHe was acting like the victim. Every time I cried about the situation and my confusion, he closed up and said that me crying is causing him to not be able to open up to me. I started to feel like I was doing something wrong because we would always have these stupid fights. But it seemed as if my point would never get across that I didn't want to  be with anyone else, etc. \\n\\nAt this point, I am at my limit and am home again. He is traveling and I am at my complete breaking point and end the relationship. He convinces me to give me another chance when he came to my city when the virus hit and rented an apartment for a month. \\n\\nThe first time I visited him, I left right away after just realizing that I am more hurt by everything than I could consider. I tell him I want to take things very slow again and make sure it's healthy. I visit 5 or 6 times in the month, but due to the quarantine, I don't see him often. And I definitely wasn't going to stay with him. \\n\\nWe are on better terms, but he says I ghosted him for a month.  The past couple of weeks he has been upset and barely speaking to me. He is clearly hurt that I didn't visit him as often as anticipated. All of a sudden he is back to normal and calling me pet names. Back to normal? \\n\\nLast night we spoke and I was upset after a week of non-communication. Just because I don't want to continue this cycle we are seemingly stuck in. \\n\\nI care about him and when things are good between us, we have an amazing relationship and conversation.  I am just looking for some guidance right now. I am at a complete turning point. I lost my job and am in between careers. I have a little savings, but after just moving again, things are really tight. I am not sure I want to continue with this relationship. He is truly amazing in his work and in a lot of ways. I love him, but I don't know what to do next. \\n\\n**tldr:\\nMy boyfriend has been having non-stop communication and jealously issues for the past 6 months. It started with an accident while running that caused him to blame me for his injuries. He says he never expected to have to \"watch his back\" with a partner. I felt guilty and stayed, but finally broke down. We are stuck in a really shitty cycle.    2\n",
       "He is having a really rough time, with final exams and other problems, making him terribly frustrated and angry with anything and anyone. He is calm and rational as a person, but now he has episodes of self harm, self hate and irrational behavior.\\n\\n He doesn't know how to deal with it and I don't know how to help him. We're students so we can't really afford to seek professional help, because it's expensive and it's hard to find someone suitable in our country.\\n\\nAlso parents would only make it worse, so it feels like a dead end. I don't know what to do, especially that he is hurting me as well sometimes and I don't want to fight no more.\\n\\nTL:DR : I want to help my bf passing some rough times and frustration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2\n",

       "For context, we both work in retail; she’s a cashier while I work a department floor. I can’t imagine this being an issue since we’re essentially at the same level in the store in terms of responsibility and leadership but advice on that would be nice. What I’m mainly concerned about is that the age difference between us could be an issue somehow. I’m an Army veteran with two tours to Afghanistan as an infantryman. I believe she’s going to school but I haven’t talked to her at length because of our work schedule and placement in the store. Another potential issue is that I haven’t been in a serious relationship before but I think I’m ready to give it a chance.\\n\\nTL;DR: She’s 19 and I’m 25, almost 26; could this age difference be an issue?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "Hey. So guys- I'm in a 2 year relationship. We moved in almost immediately together because it fit so well.\\n\\n\\nI thought everything was kind off going fine until yesterday. He tried to ask me for sex two days in a row but I didnt feel it because the act of asking me directly is a huge turnoff to me when I'm not in the mood yet. Maybe that's stupid. \\n Thats why yesterday I decided to try to initiate. The problem? I normally try it more subtle... by kissing, making out.  But it never ever ever works. Not once in all this time. That's my fault probably, I know. Well nevertheless I tried to do it more his \"way\". We were sitting on the bed and I asked him if he would like to have sex. He didnt really reply and that was it. \\n\\nA few minutes forward and I lay next to him and ask him what was going on. He said it sucked what I was trying to do. Because I didnt follow up on the question. Well, because Ibwas waiting for consent. That's what I do if he asks me.\\n\\nAnd then it all started. He told me how  unsatisfied he is. That he doesnt wanna ask for sex because it feels like he gets turned down anyway. That he wants me to be more dominant and aggressive about getting sex. In itself all reasonable I guess.\\nThe problem is, which I told him several times already, that I dont feel like I have the skills for that. Everytime I tried to kinda go there he didnt get it or ignored me. I know I'm passive when it comes to sex and I genuinely tried to change it more. I told him honestly that it comes from tons of sexual trauma with my ex. It hurt to talk about it and I broke down completely, sobbing. \\n\\nThe thing is that I just dont understand how all of it escalated that much. He never communicates properly. All the stuff he said I had to work an hour for. He barely talked, just a few unemotional sentences. I just feel so bad right now.\\nI tried to explain to him that I get why he would be uncomfortable asking but I, even thought he didnt realize I tried to initiate, tried to get sex dozent of times and never got it. I feel so frustrated how little he tried to understand me. I tried to also understand that I get he has his preferences and I will try to initiate that way... but it's just not good enough because I dont feel turned on by asking directly. \\n\\nI just feel sooo disappointed.  I thought he was a \"good guy\". We can spend 24/7 together and are fine. We are always together. He is my best friend. But now I feel intensely judged and uncomfortable. I feel like my tries to communicate (I'm on the lower end of the spectrum and really try to communicate well because of that) are always met with one sentence factual answers. \\n\\n\\nFinally- maybe you'll guys suggest breaking up. I understand that sentiment but please also understand how hard it is for me. He is my second relationship. My first was really really bad. We fit like best friends. I had him for 2 years almost everyday. I'm just... confused.\\n\\nAlso: I know I need therapy. I'm already looking for a good therapist. \\n\\nThanks for your help.\\n\\nTL;DR : Cant initiate sex with bf because he doesnt see it as initiating, communicating with him fails completely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
       "I’ll keep this short. My bf and I are in our early 20s, have been together for a year and a half, living together for a year. We have every intention of building a life together, getting married, all that jazz.\\n\\nHere’s the issue. I get upset about stuff like any other person and I cry when I get upset like any other person. And when I get upset and cry, I usually like to rant and have someone listen to me. But I hate telling my boyfriend about my problems because of the way he reacts and he hates it when I don’t tell him about my problems. So I tell him. And it always ends the same: with him telling me I’m stupid, fucked up, or that it’s my fault and proceeding to yell at me (why does he think this is helpful) and tell me that what I’m experiencing is invalid, that my feelings are invalid. I’ve told him that what he does doesn’t help me and that the best thing he can do for me when I rant about my problems is either distract me by talking to me about something else or just not say anything and hug me. He says that my way won’t work and that he will not have me “go down a rabbit hole” because he didn’t say anything. I go down a rabbit hole because he opens his mouth and says shit like “you’re stupid and fucked up”. It makes me feel worse than I already did. I don’t think he has the right to tell me what’s best for me because I know that for myself.\\n\\nWe don’t agree on this because I think his methods are ineffective. He even says he can’t deal with me and that he doesn’t know what to do. But I always tell him that the best thing he can do for me is just to hug me and listen to me talk. Buuuut he refuses to do that because he thinks it won’t work. He hasn’t even tried. And every time we talk about this, he just tells me that I’m wrong and don’t know shit. Am I?\\n\\nTL;DR: I get upset sometimes about random shit. My bf always wants me to talk to him about it but doesn’t react well. We’ve talked about it. I gave him a solution that will work FOR SURE. He won’t try it and just tells me that I’m wrong.

       "TL;DR I worry for my ex(depression) post break up, and wonder if I should allow calling or agree to cut ties.\\n\\nThe reason I'm(23M) asking this is because my ex(22F) shared with me years ago that she had depression/cutting tendencies and about losing people important in her life. She's a sweetheart, introverted and only opens up to people whom she really trusts. We needed to break up because(mainly) of her family's religious disapproval of me (atheist, but they basically disapproves of anyone except of theirs, obsolete yes) and she understands that. We agreed to end it post college.\\n\\nWe didn't really say anything when college ended. She moved back to her country and we still chat, but it became less frequent. I wanted to bring up our status when she came back to visit, but she avoided the topic. \\n\\nThe thing is she ghosts me, and reappears, and ghosts me, and reappears again. It wasn't too long ago (2weeks)that she appeared in my dm to tell me about her new found hobby in this quarantine/family stuffs/insecurities, but after that she continues the ghosting again.\\n\\nFinally, called her to clarify our status and she agrees that we are friends. But she also said if you don't want me talking to you ever, just tell me.\\n\\nTo me, I don't mind either way; I've gotten used to the ghosting but if she needs a friend I'm always there. She's fun to chat with. As long as she clarifies that we are friends. \\n\\nShe seems to be coping well, but again because of what she shared, I'm not sure. Am I worrying too much?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "I wish I could turn back time to when I had no worries in life and when my mother was here. My grandparents had inherited diseases and my mother passed away from the same. I grew up with no father and things were tough with me basically javing to raise myself and having to help my mother in poverty until we pulled out of that.\\n\\nI grew up around drugs and violence and I have essentially lost almost all of my family (some lost to drugs, some gunned down, some took their own lives). My ex girlfriend also slipped up and cheated on me once and we broke up weeks ago. I am so frustrated and I don’t know what to do anymore. We went through all the shit just for her to not see me succeed how she wanted me to. \\n\\nI got into university and tried to walk in a straight path unlike my family, but I don’t think I could keep moving forward. I try my best to clear my mind. I take my motorcycle out for rides alone in the hills and through the country roads to clear my head, but nothing really makes me feel at peace.\\n\\nI try to medicate with some drugs to calm me down now since I have trouble sleeping at all and I have tried eating and doing basic things, but I just want to stay where I am and I can’t come back from this. I just feel like I am essentially a robot now with no emotion. Then my ex came to my place because I couldn’t pick up her calls. She knows eveythimg about my life and she knows my situation.\\n\\nShe was the inly one who understood me and I love her. What she did hurts, but a part of me wants her back. She brought me food and she asked me if I would let her be here for me. I don’t know what to do. I am hurt by what she had done, but I also love her and I am windering if maybe the pros of havung her around outweigh the cons? Should I try and fix my relationship with her?\\n\\nTldr: my ex girlfriend who cheated reached out to me and she said she wants to be here and support me while I get better. She also asked if maybe we could get back together. I love her, but I am lost in how to move forward with life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

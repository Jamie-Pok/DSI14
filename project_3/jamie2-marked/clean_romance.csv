"I often wonder if I'll end my life with anyone, and if I'd even need to. I know that some people live fine lives alone, and I've been a lot of a loner. Not because I don't want to date, mind you, but because I don't really want my parents in my business as long as I'm living with them. 

So I'm keeping serious relationships to if/when I'd actually move out, but in the meantime I'm wondering what I'm missing, and how much of my personality remains untouched due to my lack of a social life.

You ever feel like that? Like you aren't really your true self if you're not commonly around someone who you actually like to be with...?",romance
"Emotional Alchemy 

I remember when I walked into that office for an errand and she was behind the desk helping me. She sat there giving me legal advice with her little portfolio. Time stopped as my awareness leaped into the nothingness of the present moment. Have you ever been so immersed in the now that your focus becomes godlike. I mean you notice everything... Like the fact that her small intelligent dark eyes would look up at mine less and less as time went on because my heavy gaze had conquered unexplored territory in her mind. I could tell what she was thinking and she knew it. Women love a man that can hold eye contact because it shows confidence, but that is child's play. I posses eye contact that startles women because of its rarity nowadays.  My gaze cuts wide and deep and if she leaves herself unguarded I will drag her to the treacherous shores of love. Anyway, as she continued with her presentation my eyes explored every inch of her. Her light freckles her bottom lip, her thick thighs everything. My emotions rivaled the four elements of nature in violence and intensity. However, I've been in this position many times so I transmuted the chaos into a friendly smile and a playful wink when I parted and walked away. Welcome to the art of Emotional  Alchemy.

"Chapter 1 - The Cruel Truth

Su Jianxi hid inside the closet, peeking through the crack at the man and woman making out.

Su Jianxi‚Äôs head whirred and practically exploded. All of the blood in her body was surging into her brain.

She was not mistaken. That man was Shen Siming, the person she loved so deeply she would give up everything for him. As for the woman, it was her good friend Su Huanran.

Yesterday, she wanted to give Shen Siming a birthday surprise, so she had purposely told him that her flight would be late, and she could not make it back in time for his birthday. In actuality, she had arrived a long time ago, and she was holding a cake as she hid in the closet, waiting for her chance to surprise Shen Siming.

Well, there was a surprise, alright. However, it was Shen Siming who surprised Su Jianxi.

It was by no means a pleasant surprise, either.

‚ÄúI love you so much, baby,‚Äù Shen Siming mumbled as he kissed Su Huanran.

Su Huanran‚Äôs fingers were buried in Shen Siming‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúIf you love me, Siming, would you marry me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, but we have to take it slow. First, let‚Äôs restore your status as the second miss of the Su Family, and then we‚Äôll make you the Best Actress at the awards‚Ä¶‚Äù

Inside the closet, Su Jianxi clenched her hands into fists, forcing herself to stay silent.

Shen Siming‚Äôs conversation with Su Huanran revealed a huge secret to Su Jianxi.

He said that he wanted to restore Su Huanran‚Äôs status as Second Miss Su. It just so happened that Su Huanran had the same surname as Su Jianxi, and the latter‚Äôs father was quite kind to Su Huanran and her mother‚Ä¶

Su Jianxi‚Äôs mind ran a mile a minute. She figured she knew the gist of it now.

Three years ago, she was the most promising young female lead in S City‚Äôs entertainment scene. However, she had given up everything for this man, and she even handed the resources she had over to Su Huanran.

It was only now that she found out how thoroughly she had been used.

Her best friend was her half-sister from a different mother. Her father had tricked her, her boyfriend had tricked her, and even her best friend had tricked her.

Everyone had played her like a puppet on their strings.

Su Jianxi ran out of the closet and stumbled away when Shen Siming and Su Huanran went into the shower together. She wanted to console herself, to tell herself that everything she had just seen was just an illusion, but her heart hurt so much right now.

## üì∑

Hello,  I am reaching out to this group in hopes that someone might  recall the  plot snippets I have listed below of a possible historical Romance  story I once read a long time ago. Unfortunately, I no longer know the   title or the author and what little bit I do recall is not a lot.   Romance paperback possible from the 80s, as I started reading Gothic and   then the bodice rippers at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

What I most recall of the story  ...

1. heroine  (virgin): approx. age of 18 to early 20s who liked to take walks  along  the cliffs that were behind her families estate and that of the   neighbor's house, that was adjacent to the estate. Her family was   friends of the people who lived in that house. I believe the grandfather   still lives there and his grandson comes an visits him and to see the   heroine (who the young man loves).
2. Strong  Male Hero: Probably  in his 30s who may be her guardian and he has  inherited the estate  somehow; he maybe seeking a wife and i believe he  finds our heroine  attractive but he may feel she is too young.

Situation I  
The   male Hero becomes ill (not sure why) and our Heroine is nursing him   during the evening in order for the housekeeper to get her rest and   during one of her night watches with our Hero, he was out of mind with a   fever and as she was caring for him, he grabbed her and she ends up in   his bed and being pinned under him, he has his way with her and takes   her virginity. As it started out as a rape, I believe the heroine ended   up being a participant in the act and that is what the master is   troubled by of thoughts of a passionate encounter.

* After  that  incident, the Heroine must have covered it up so that the staff  would  not be aware the next morning and she does not say anything about  the  episode when a staff member arrives that morning after;
* When  the  hero/master does recovers from his illness, he is nagged by a  sense of  something did happen and needs to find the person who was in  his room  that night;
* He does not believe it was a dream as it seemed too passionate and real to him to be anything but what really happened;

Situation 2  
Not   sure why the heroine goes to the neighboring home of the grandfather   and the young man, but she does. The young man tells her he loves her   and wants to marry her, but she does not love him. she may agree to   marry this young man just to have a home.

* Our  hero/master does go  in search of her at the neighbor‚Äôs home (don't  believe he knows it was  here in his bed that night) he may be asking  why she ran away and asking  her to return to the estate. he returns to  the estate without her.
* She   does go back to the estate and it maybe that she feels he may not  think  of her as anything other than a child but she loves him and wants  to be  near him and to run the house is better than not being near him.
* However,   sometime after she returns to the estate, the hero does learn it was   her that night in his bed when he was delirious with fever and he seeks   her out in the dining room where she is doing some work. and he   confesses his love for her and happy ending.

**Situation III**

* ¬∑  The Heroine does return back to the estate and I feel as though the she  is pregnant. \[I do not know if she tells anyone or if the housekeeper  finds evidence that the heroine was the woman in the bed\]
* ¬∑  I do recall a scene where the heroine is in the dining room and maybe  going through the estates china for cleaning or for getting ready for a  dinner, but the hero does seek her in this room and confronts her as I  believe at this point the hero knows that it was our heroine that was  the woman in his bed.  \[do not recall how he finds out, but he does\]
* ¬∑  I feel as though it is during this dining room scene that the Hero  declares his feelings for the Heroine and she does the same towards him.  \[I believe he asks her to marry him and she accepts his proposal. I  believe this is how the story ends\]",romance
"I have two, what I consider to be, very close friendships. One person I met when we were four years old and the other I met when we were eleven. The three of us remained close throughout our schooldays before going off to college where we still kept in touch and followed the trajectory of each others lives. I feel like these people have been part of my life for so long that it's as natural to be around them as it is my own sister. While we do share some interests, I believe our friendship is based more on having similar personalities and attitudes towards how we go about life. The three of us are very much cut from the same cloth in that sense. I can typically always relate with the things they're feeling because if I were in their shoes I imagine myself reacting a similar way.

But still despite us all being twenty-five years old, when they turn to me and say they have a boyfriend it's like this wall goes up that I can't see behind. I always wonder ""how did that happen?"" What in your interactions with someone causes you to want to enter into a partnership arrangement? What is the incentive? Similarly, when I am being pursued by someone with intentions for a partnership agreement I struggle to understand what it is they want from me or see in me that is making them act like this. I have never been friends with these people. In fact, our interactions had always been pretty minimal prior to the actual courtship process. Do they think I am pretty? Do they think I say interesting things? Do they want to have sex with me? Do I have certain life resume that make me a good candidate for marriage? Do I remind them of their mother?

Everyone I knew in college would spend time scrolling through Tinder just as they would scroll through Twitter, an endless search for... what, exactly? For some I can see why a romantic partnership would make sense, usually if it is in line with their goals. I know some people who want nothing more than to get married, have kids, and buy a very specific type of house. Finding romantic chemistry with someone is pretty pivotal for that happening. But for many more people I'm left to assume that they're on some sort of autopilot: the only life outline they've been shown is one where a romantic partner becomes one's primary relationship or maybe they meet someone who makes them feel fuzzy and they think ""why not?"" 

For me not only am I seemingly not attracted to people but none of my life goals require an emotional partnership. If anything, an emotional partnership would just make being truly happy in achieving my life goals more difficult. I simply don't understand what makes a partnership so appealing or rather... I don't understand why there isn't more of a diversity in preference. Maybe if one third of people I meet in life found partnership to be the most appealing relationship arrangement whereas another third instead thrived contributing to communities and another third just liked the best to coast by themselves. That array makes sense to me. But it's not like that. Everyone is seemingly searching for this thing and I don't understand any of it and when I ask no one seems to be able to explain.",romance
"It was basically PG-13 rated stuff. 
Didn‚Äôt want to attack her with my tongue just yet so I hope the smooching didn‚Äôt come off as boring. 
I‚Äôm falling for this woman quickly. 
I trip over my words a lot n think she might grow tired of that. 
There I go talking myself out of the good things",romance
"So we‚Äôre gonna call this guy ‚ÄúJamal‚Äù. So Jamal (M/18) and me (F/19) and I go to the same college. 

I met him through mutual friends. I‚Äôm not the type to initiate conversation with people because I have social anxiety. And usually when people do come up and talk to me and look past my awkwardness, jts rare. So this Jamal always comes up and talks to me about anything he can think of or anything we have in common, doesn‚Äôt matter what it is he will talk to me. For example we had a class together so he would ask me if I thought the homework was hard or if I knew how to do anything, stuff like that. And whenever I‚Äôm with the friend that introduced me to him, he will greet me first then her so I noticed that too. 

During our first semester, I‚Äôd been having a lot of mental health issues and just needed a break so I stopped going to class, idk where I‚Äôd be If I hadn‚Äôt have stopped going. But yeah everyday he would ask where I am to another one of our mutual friends and he would always say he misses me. At the time he didn‚Äôt have anyway to contact me outside of seeing each other in person. I went up to campus one day to visit my friends bc like I said I stopped going and my mutual friend texted him and and let him know I was here and he came to where we were and he gave me the biggest hug ever and told me he missed me. We talked for a little and he left so I thought that was sweet of him  

Another thing is he‚Äôs always sooo excited and happy to see me like he‚Äôs always hella smiley when I‚Äôm around. I‚Äôm kind of the same way lol. 

Recently like 3 days ago, me my two mutual friends and him all hung out. We went out for food and had a good time. That day is when i realized I like him. Idk what it was but we finally got to talk together and have some space from everyone and it was just us and we kinda clicked in my opinion. We were laughing the whole time. One of the friends that was with us pulled me aside and we went to the bathroom bc girls go to the br together lol but she was basically saying how she thinks he likes me and how since day one she‚Äôs been waiting for us to get together and stuff and she said the chemistry is there... she‚Äôs not wrong at all. And sometimes I noticed we would play fight like flirting a little. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize I liked him til that day tbh, but everything added up. Every time I we text I would kind of get nervous and wonder why now I know. Whenever I see him in person I get excited and I always want to hug him. And I genuinely think he‚Äôs such a sweetheart, he accepts me for who I am, I know that bc he actually took the tome to get to know me and get through the awkwardness, most people just think I‚Äôm weird and shy and rude so they stop talking to me but he didn‚Äôt do that... I guess he saw something in me? and he‚Äôs really cute and tall...‚ù§Ô∏è

One of our mutual friends told me ‚Äúhe likes you‚Äù and I asked him ‚Äúdid he say the three words?? I like (my name)‚Äù he said ‚Äúwell he said he enjoys your company and he says he misses you all the time, and he thinks you‚Äôre funny.‚Äù And that‚Äôs just not clear at all, that could mean anything. 

But let me get into why I‚Äôm unsure of his feelings for me... he‚Äôs friends with A LOT of people. And A LOT of girls... maybe I‚Äôm just one of those girls that he befriended. And when we first started knowing each other he asked me if I had any friends for him to date and he asked if one of my friends was single and stuff... and that moves me onto me not being his type. His type is ‚Äúblack and pretty‚Äù in his words. He even asked me if I could give him one of my friends number and they look NOTHING like me. I‚Äôm not the prettiest as I‚Äôm not hella skinny either. I don‚Äôt really wear makeup that often either so I just don‚Äôt know. 

So basically I just don‚Äôt know... I kind of just wanna come out and tell him straight on that I like him and why kind of like ‚Äúconfessing my love‚Äù except I don‚Äôt love him lol. but I don‚Äôt wanna ruin our friendship if things go south or if he just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. Honestly If one of our mutual friends could tell him and get his reaction I would be good. I would either stop hanging out where they dorm if he doesn‚Äôt like me OR I would come and hang out all the time if he does. Can someone help me know the best way to go about this? Thanks. ‚ù§Ô∏è",romance
I'll just keep this simple I am 17 year Old male. I look good. many girls have asked me out but I have never said yes since I didn't have any feelings for them.

"I‚Äôve been friends with my best friend for six years. We‚Äôve always just been platonic friends, and, because we even sort of look similar, have even joked about being siblings and pretended to be at parties. I‚Äôve been her wingman, she‚Äôs been my wing woman, we talk about our romances, we‚Äôve seen each other through different relationships, good ones and bad ones. We fought a while back and stopped talking for a while, then reconciled. 

I‚Äôve been excited and happy to have her back in my life, and we spend a lot of time hanging out and talking about our days, watching shows, doing puzzles, smoking. A few weeks ago, I invited her on a trip for my birthday. It was a great time, we got an Airbnb, and on our last night there, we slept together. 

It was our first time ever being intimate, and it was great and exciting. We were both into it, but, knowing we might put our friendship at risk, we decided to not mention it, move past it, and go on with our lives. Things are back to normal, and we haven‚Äôt talked about it at all. But I feel like things have changed; I see her just a little differently and now I wonder about what it would be like to have someone who knows me so well and who I know so well be more than just my friend. 

It seems like it‚Äôd be perfect, and I like the way I get nervous when I think about talking to her about it all. But I don‚Äôt know if I should just nip my feelings in the bud and move on, or bring this up and see what she has to say about it. What do I do?",romance

"Theres this mutual friend who recently became part of our group and I've always kind of noticed that whenever he says hi or bye, he gets all awkward with me like he tries to hug me but I just give him a handshake cause I don't know him like that yet.

He tends to get all googly eyed around me, like once my sister and I had our car parked in front of  of church and he saw us through the window, so he came outside, opened the front car door (I was in the passenger seat) and he tried to get in, like just being silly.
After that it started to develop more into something obvious. Our car started to have issues so I asked around who knows how to work on cars and they said that he does. So even though he was sick, his sister told me that he would be on his way to take a look at the car. He came and when I opened the door, his face was all red and like an awkward ""hi"" lol.
The next day we saw each other at church and he kept asking if I still needed someone to look at the car and I said don't worry about it if your sick, my dad could find someone, but he would just insist.
Before I had to go look for my seat, he said to me btw that dress looks really nice.
After church was over, I was talking to someone else and I could just see him from the outside smiling directly at me. I was leaving through the door, and I didn't notice he was holding the door open, then he said bye (my name) and he just followed me to my car and tried to talk some more and still kept telling me to let him know if I need a car mechanic.
Days later, they all went out to eat as a group and once my mom and sister got there, he asked them out loud ""where is (my name)?"" and they replied to him ""oh she's sick at home she couldn't come"" 
My mom said herself she thinks he likes me, and she is always right about these things, also it's a known fact that moms always know lol.

Now the catch about him is that we've invited him in the past to things and he doesn't show up. He told us yesterday that he was too lazy to drive. He also doesn't try to get to know me, whenever we are hanging out, or texting, he just talks about random stuff. When theres an opportunity to ask ""wbu?"" he just talks about himself. Very weird to me.",romance

"Hello all! Hope you are having a romantic time :)

I'll jump straight into it. I have been singing/working at a place for about 3 years. There is a girl there (I'll call her Samantha) who has been there for about 2 and I have developed a uh... pretty serious crush. I really enjoy being around her and talking to her gives me little pangs of happiness and in the glorious moments where we make eye contact it's like I'm a pathetic little schoolboy again.The routine of the place is always the same- and when she is there I always try to start a small conversation with her. We always seem to leave work at the same time and we have a nice little chat, I'll try to make an effort to talk to her, and she seems to laugh or chuckle at my dumb jokes (at least I think she does, I'm not sure if she's just being polite). But really, that's all it is. It never goes beyond the small talk...

And here is where it gets difficult.

Because of the place that we work at it would be weird if I asked her out there. When we leave to the train station I could ask her as we part ways to different platforms, but I guess it seems a bit rushy at a train station and I've never worked up the courage to ask her. I have thought about waiting at the same platform she is at to just extend the conversation- but my head tells me that is a little creepy.

It has got to the point where I have every reason to leave that job. The only reason I don't is because I might get to see Samantha, even thought the actually work is boring and I hate it, and there are some times that she isn't there.

She never really seems to be on messenger so sending a facebook message isn't really an option.

Advice anyone? How do I ask Samantha out? I haven't properly done this for 9 years.

TIBETE ‚Äì o novo romance de Silas Corr√™a Leite ‚Äì E quando voc√™ n√£o quiser mais ser gente?
-O novo romance do escritor Silas Corr√™a Leite, lan√ßado ao final do ano passado pela Editora Jaguatirica, RJ, vem bem a calhar, tendo em vista o tenebroso momento em que se resta o Planeta Terra, e particularmente o Brasil tamb√©m em crise sem precedentes hist√≥ricos, em que h√° uma fal√™ncia generalizada de valores e estruturas sociais, terrivelmente depondo com o que deveria ser o p√∫blico fito √©tico-plural-comunit√°rio da  sociedade nesses tempos de falta de qualidade de vida e de uma conviv√™ncia humana de baix√≠ssimo n√≠vel. Fugir seria a melhor estrat√©gia? Loucos escrevem. C√©u ou inferno moram nos desfechos?  O personagem principal do livro, nesse contexto todo relata sobre as tormentas de um ex-escritor marcado, com altos e baixos na vida, mas, afinal evolu√≠do socialmente falando, e que num estranho s√∫bito momento, um bendito dia saca que n√£o √© feliz; avalia que o que conquistou n√£o o satisfaz, quando conclui que ‚Äúvencer na vida‚Äù n√£o √© tudo, n√£o significa nada, n√£o faz sentido, e, parafraseando Caetano veloso se questiona: tudo o que conquistou, a que ser√° que se destina? Fechamento de ciclo.
De cara resolve pular fora do sistema, da redoma de infernos que √© seu meio conturbado. Larga tudo e vai em busca de um lugar para chamar de c√©u, um infinito particular que seja. Quer um canto para se esconder de ser gente, de ver gente, se tratar de si, se reconciliar, cavar uma trilha, um buraco, antes que fa√ßa uma besteira... Estresse e paranoia de finalmente se descobrir sendo uma coisa que n√£o quis ao final de tudo, passando da idade do lobo.
Volta para sua aldeia, Itarar√©-SP, foge de existir. L√° vai morar no mato, mal sabendo lavar um par de meias, um len√ßo, ou fritar um ovo. Ter√° que, numa emergencial e improvisada cultura de subsist√™ncia, adaptar-se na marra, longe da urbanidade tant√£ e da civiliza√ß√£o em derrocada, para repensar o caminho que fez, como se numa esp√©cie de jornada espiritual de recolhimento tempor√£o, de reconcilia√ß√£o e mesmo de depura√ß√£o de sua interioridade ferida, de sua sensibilidade lixada de ver, fermentar, engolir sapos, aceitar regras, chorar, sofrer, conviver, sobreviver... Com o mundo num labir√≠ntico caos, com sua crise de identidade de turr√£o, concorrente, sedent√°rio, j√° obeso, calvo e com problemas de sa√∫de, al√©m de s√≠ndromes pintando num campo minado de cobran√ßas rid√≠culas, entre boletos de posses e sach√™s viciados de poses insatisfat√≥rias, mais doen√ßas paraexistenciais e questionamentos de neuras, o personagem enquanto se adapta num barrac√£o dentro de um manto de selva, vai relembrando o que sofreu, as perdas e danos, idas e vindas, trai√ß√µes e incompletudes, cart√©is e cassinos, bolando artes loucas dentro do funil da crise de perquirir, ao mesmo tempo em que compactua com o recanto que ergueu pra si, e confronta a natureza prim√°ria pertinho o abra√ßando e sustentando, na sua  busca de paz, o terr√≠vel encontro consigo mesmo, pela frustra√ß√£o com tudo, o nada que √© tudo, feito um desorientado cidad√£o p√≥s-moderno num mundo corrompido, procurando se achar enquanto h√° tempo. 
Na capa do romance de 382 p√°ginas, o aviso: ‚ÄúDestruam este di√°rio, ou destruam suas vidas‚Äù. A obra √© isso mesmo, uma esp√©cie de di√°rio de resist√™ncia e luta, de busca da reformata√ß√£o do ser, de uma transforma√ß√£o radical, mais, a de busca de um buraco para se encaixar depois de questionamentos, se isolando feito um Tibete √≠ntimo, uma guarita, uma c√°psula de nave, um jardim secreto, um esconderijo, uma Pas√°rgada, uma Shangri-l√°, que √© na emerg√™ncia da situa√ß√£o de conflito e confronto, a periferia rural de Itarar√©, na lonjura distante de um lugar em que o judas perdeu o All-Star. 
O deslocado personagem meio eremita que sonha um Mosteiro Ateu ou um Monast√©rio Lico, as vezes introspectivo, de acordo com a lua, as vezes anarquista libert√°rio, ou rom√¢ntico sonhador da p√° virada, quando n√£o incendi√°rio, perigoso, detona tudo, registra, narra, incendeia irraz√µes. E o leitor sendo testado, tamb√©m vai acabar fazendo uma viagem de recolhimento que o livro Tibete faculta e induz, antes que venha o cometa ou o cavalo amarelo do Apocalipse. Vai nessa toada o romance.
Lendo o Tibete voc√™ sofre, se encontra, revolta, se confronta, assusta mas se requalifica, a repensar melhor sua vidinha merreca e seus infernos de grifes, impropriedades, consumismo e obriga√ß√µes piradas de meros vazios existenciais. E pode clarear a mente adubada pela m√≠dia abutre; deixar de ser bovinamente ref√©m do consumismo irado, come√ßando assim a vitimizar conquistas esp√∫rias, pois, como diz Raul Seixas, ‚ÄúQuem entra em buraco de rato/De rato tem que transar‚Äù. Nesse mundo insano, vencer numa sociedade assim n√£o significa nada, muito menos m√©rito not√≥rio.  Liberte-se tamb√©m. Leia Tibete e tamb√©m Tibete-se. Eis o verbo

I DROPPED HIT SONG STRICKLY ROMANCE!!! [CHECK IT OUT](https://youtu.be/VxC8X16ZrJU),romance
"I am really into her but when I asked her out she said no because she wasn't  really looking for anyone to date right now.She has already been in a couple of relationships so I don't know if that was a factor for her decisions or not,this is the final year that well be in the same class before we separate and go into different ways.I think my love for her might be fleeting but still I want to be with her.

I need help",romance
"Me: I just wanted to be a mathematician and some fine maths lady to fall in love with.

Her: What happened?

Me: I failed at maths!

Her: I guess, we both did.",romance
"My friends give me a lot of advice when it comes to this girl, I've had an off and on crush on her for many years, and recently I became part of a semi large circle of friends and just a little bit ago I asked one of my friends how to ask her for her number without it sounding like a booty call, and he said he wasn't that experienced cause when he got his gfs phone number they were already dating, so I asked her and she said to say ""hey i was wondering if I could get your number so we don't always have to use social media to communicate"" so I sent that and she said ""yes of course!"" And sent her number and I sent mine. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ",romance
We are both in the same class and we've been chatting for a while but I'm having trouble doing it in person. We are friends but not that close since we'd talked mostly through chat. I always get nervous around her. Advice? ,romance
"I‚Äôm 26, male. She‚Äôs 23.

We are going to spend a few days in a cottage that is secluded, in about 3 days. This year has challenged us a bit, and we haven't had any private time away from the house in over a year and a half, possibly even two years. We have had ups and downs when it comes to being intimate.

Inside the cabin is a large jacuzzi tub, large shower that is also heated.

Outside is a gazebo and fire pit.

We are looking for romantic ideas while we spend time alone there.

The plan so far: Hoping for great weather to be outside (the entire time preferably) to lounge around, lay out, read books, etc. I plan on being nude, she feels more comfortable in a swimsuit/lingerie.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!",romance
"My father introduced me to the stepson of one of his co-workers. The two of us have been talking for approximately a month. He‚Äôs cute, sweet, really really chill, and it is clear that there is a mutual attraction between us. We have exchanged Valentine‚Äôs Day gifts and we finally met in person last Friday. Not only that, we have expressed mutual interest in seeing each other again and are still keeping contact with each other. I feel like a giddy little girl whenever I talk to him and I really feel like there is a connection there. Or maybe I‚Äôm just overexcited because I 
have no real relationship experience despite being in my mid-twenties (as pathetic as that sounds).

Do you think it is safe to ask him if he would be interested in making this a serious thing or 
should I do it after another date or two?

EDIT: 
In case anybody is wondering about the V-Day gifts:
Actually I had the idea in my head but repressed it because I thought it would be creepy. However, 
my dad then suggested I do it so we bought a small and simple box of chocolate to give to his stepdad to give to him. And when I met up with him, he gave me a small bear in return.",romance
"Just met a girl online and been talking just a few days. I'm 26m. Shes 22f. I asked what the most romantic thing is she thought someone could do for her. Just cause we've already talked about family, hobbies, work, relationship goals, and small talk goes nowhere. But shes just not responding. She already did this with another situation that was just miscommunication without trying to talk about it. Opinions? 

P.s. I really want to make something work here. She seems my type, and I havent been in a relationship for a while so I've told myself I'm going to do whatever it takes to put my all into someone again. Thanks in advance",romance
https://youtu.be/DNHOFIHA5Yw,romance
"I absolutely adore giving my partner gifts, I always write down any little thing he mentions or shows interest in and later on surprise him with it with no occasion:D Wondered if any of you do it as well? Would be fun to see other peoples lists of ideas haha",romance
"How many peaks were there? He longed to look upon them. Two or three but symbols. The real road ahead had many more mountains. Lawrence gazed at the sky, the stars beyond. He was closer, the sound vibrations reached his soul and he knew. ",romance
"My boyfriend broke up with me a week ago.  We have been together for 15 months.  I am still feeling devastated until now.  I dont know how to move on and not feel this pain.  I dreamt about him tonight and I woke up crying.  So, how can I get through this?",romance
My crush who I've liked for a very long time just told me hes in LOVE with ME.,romance
"Hi everyone! I am going to be sending a snail mail letter and package to my long distance boyfriend. I‚Äôm looking for some suggestions for some cute/romantic gift suggestions! I‚Äôve got a couple of small ideas to include, but would like to add one or 2 more items to send him :)",romance
"I met this guy on a dating app he‚Äôs 31 I‚Äôm 28F. He was the first one I talked to on there and basically the last one because I‚Äôm done with online dating now. Anyways, we talked for about 2 months (periodically) before actually meeting because our work schedules were pretty conflicting and I live about an hour away. I could tell from his texts that he seemed like a pretty down to earth guy and I was excited for our date, but was trying to not to get my hopes up too much. Well turns out he‚Äôs adorable and I was instantly attracted to him and his personality. He isn‚Äôt a hunk with a 6 pack and chiseled jaw law,  he‚Äôs actually on the shorter side with an average body type, but omg he‚Äôs the sexiest man I have ever met. He has these golden brown eyes that I could gaze into forever and a cute little Chicago accent. I‚Äôm sort of a hopeless romantic if you can‚Äôt tell, but this one knocked it out of the park for me. I don‚Äôt fall for people very often and haven‚Äôt felt this way in awhile. So this has been a real struggle for me. So here it goes, our first date went well and I felt like we both had a really good time. We went to 3 bars talked a lot and danced and it just felt natural. I spent the night at his place but we didn‚Äôt have sex because we were both pretty drunk honestly ( I know real classy, but it just happened). So fast forward to now about another 2 months later he finally has some time off work and asks me if I would like to see each other again while he is off. I say of course and we agreed to meet on a Friday that week because I was going to be out there for an interview anyways. When I told him I had an interview his eyes lit up and our whole date he was saying how he really hoped I got the job so I can eventually move closer. Our date went really well again. I spent the night, magic happened and then went home after we had breakfast. He was texting me everyday up until I was supposed to get my results for the interview. I never heard from them and all he really said was ‚Äúdamn‚Äù. And he hasn‚Äôt texted me since. It hurts, I‚Äôm not gona lie. I feel rejected on both ends for not getting the job and him ending it because I live  too far basically. Our schedules do conflict but I feel that if we really wanted to make it work we could. And I would be willing to do this. But now I feel that this is the end of the road because I didn‚Äôt get this job.. and it just feels unfair. What do I do?

Sorry this is a bit wordy.",romance
" 

Every morning we wake up to a kiss and a cuddle

and maybe even some passionate morning sex

We start the day off by being so close in each others arms

Even if its quick because we woke up a little late.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday we begin the day with such love.

Everyday we begin the day feeling special

We start off the day knowing we are truly loved,

With a smile and a big spring in our step.

&amp;#x200B;

We grab our coffee and go about our day,

working, events, childcare, etc‚Ä¶....

We go about the day always thinking of each other

sending the odd ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù texts throughout the day.

&amp;#x200B;

We are hopeless, We are in love

And nothing can get in the way

Nothing could distract us

Or turn our heads away.

&amp;#x200B;

We both feel so safe and secure,

We both are sure that we are truly loved

We have each other back

Through the good days and bad.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of a hard day at work

We come home to a love like no other

There to offer a warm hug and great encouragement

As we put our day aside to enjoy our evenings together.

&amp;#x200B;

We enjoy our evenings together as we are on this crazy adventure

We make each day count as we are never promised another

We walk on the beach and dance under the stars

We make beautiful love through everything we do.

&amp;#x200B;

We lay on the sofa to watch a good movie

As we unwind from a hectic day

We take in a deep breath as a sigh of relief

That we are home with our true love feeling so safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Our life is a wonderful adventure

More love than we have ever known

We feel like we can do anything

As we make each other our king and queen.

&amp;#x200B;

We just love being together

And being each other very best friend

We love traveling, going to concerts, doing life together

And living a life true adventure.

&amp;#x200B;

Our love is very special and can never be questioned

The love that we have can never be tainted

It wouldn't matter if a true beauty queen or a hunk came along

We'd no that's just surface and not worth a second look.

&amp;#x200B;

We are so perfect for each other

That we cherish our love

We treat each other amazingly

the romance and love will never die!",romance

"So, i like this guy who is on a discord server im on. I have been on for a month and i get along with everyone on there. There is this one guy that i think is absolutely adorable. We talk alot (usually from about 5pm to 1am) straight. This has been going on about a week everyday.
The thing is, our humor is very pervy so we make jokes about it all the time. I usually start the conversation ( i always do even in friendships). But he drives it and makes an effort to learn about me.
We have eachother on our other social media's , but we usually talk on discord or snapchat.
Also, one of the guys on the server teases us about being a couple which we are not.
I just want to know if i am reading too much into this, if he is leading me on or if i may have a chance.
Thanks and im sorry if my first post to reddit is a bit awkward. I just really need help! 

I messed up on the title, its supposed to be ""or""",romance
"I met this guy on Tinder during the Qurantine. We have virtual dates, we have meme wars, we have bonded over mental health issues, we are both left-wings, and we share similar hobbies/interests. He is sweet, supportive, easygoing, caring, empathetic(maybe a little too empathic but that makes me feel more protective of him), and very well-read. i have told him about the emotional abuse that I suffered and he expressed a desire to hold me and console me. I sent him an audioclip of me singing Selena‚Äòs ‚ÄúDreaming of You‚Äù and he said he was touched and that he would save it. I melt whenever I hear him call me ‚Äúbabe‚Äú or his ‚Äúbeautiful princess‚Äú. I look forward to hearing from each day. Whenever I see him smile, I smile. Whenever he‚Äôs hurting, I wish to console him and take his pain away.

I thought I figured it out the true meaning of true love. I thought I found my Prince Charming. However today, I told him that I can‚Äôt picture myself ever having kids for multiple reasons and that I would have a hard time conceiving anyway since I have Turner Syndrome. I then proceeded to asked him how he pictures his future family and told me that he does eventually kids and that it was a dream of his to be a dad one day. I then asked him where we stood and he said that he still really likes me and still wants to continue the relationship. He even made a light joke saying, ‚ÄúAnd hey! Less chances of any accidents when we have fun!‚Äú to which I giggled at.

But still....that got me thinking....I still really really really like him.....but still. Would I be wasting my time trying to pursue this guy? I mean, if we‚Äôre on different pages in terms of family dynamics.....would that be fair to either one of us to stay together long-term when we could be looking for other people who are on the same page with this. But at the same time.....it‚Äôs just hard to just drop somebody you feel deeply connected to. I still yearn to have picnics with him, play video games with him, watching movies with him, kissing him, letting him take my virginity, and many other fun stuff.

However, my eyes  have been open to the fact that I allowed myself to get to caught up in the passion and allowed myself to think that I was in love. I learned that there is a lot more that I have to learn about this guy. And made me worry if we are incompatiblue HERE.....what other incompatibilities will we have in the future? I feel so stupid and embarrassed. After all, I‚Äôm a 24-year of graduate student.  I should have known better than to mentally prepare myself for a future with a man I‚Äôve only for a month and never even met in person yes . But It‚Äòs probably my fault for not dating in high school or my undergrads. I have only been on a handful amount of dates prior to but no serious relationship. I don‚Äôt even have any sexual experience. Not even a simple kiss....üò¢ Therefore, I am like an infant when it comes to the game of love.....",romance
"Doesn't matter whom you are with.

Doesn't matter where you are going.

Don't you know I'm still waiting here for you.

And pray for you.

&amp;#x200B;

In the sunny days, Sun will light your day.

In the windy days, wind will lead your way.

I have to say, you're my treasure moments .

Never gonna walk away.

&amp;#x200B;

In the rainy days, rains will share my tears.

In the stormy days, storms will steal my pain.

Just go your way and leave things all behind.

Spread your wings and fly away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretending you're mine.

I'm wishing you'll be fine.

The moments we share never die.

You've made a difference to my life.

And let me realize.

The feeling I've got deep inside.

P.S. from this romantic song here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br0MBSUVVcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br0MBSUVVcQ)",romance
"The temperature inside the factory dropped abruptly, the whole place started to feel chilly. The cold penetrated their thin summer clothing and seeped into their skin, causing them to shudder silently.

Scarface was stunned by that man‚Äôs immense presence. He was about to slap her, but his hand froze in place the moment that man came in, hovering a few millimeters away from her face. He stood there, stunned, having completely forgotten what he had intended to say.

The glance alone made him feel as though all the blood in his veins had frozen over. It was so piercing that he shivered on the spot.

Even though it was the height of summer right now, he felt as though he was standing in the middle of winter.

So, this was the brutal, heartless, cold-blooded, and bloodthirsty Lu Yanmu from the rumors?

Gu Qingmang had mentally prepared herself for this. In fact, she had planned everything out before he even arrived.

Though, the moment she actually saw him, her tears instantly began to flow. 

So, she really could see him again. The man she had lost out of her sheer stubbornness.

Now that she had gotten a second chance, she would never let go of him again.

‚ÄúSob‚Ä¶‚Äù Qingmang wanted to say something, but all her words turned to sobs. Her crying was especially loud in the silent night.

There were so many things she wanted to say right now, but she could not form a single word now that she was facing him. Thus, in the end, all she could do was let the tears blur her vision.

She remembered that she had also cried in the past life when she first saw him after being kidnapped. Back then, however, she had cried out of fear and shock from the kidnapping. This time, they were tears of joy. The joy of regaining what she had once lost.

If she could, she would rush up to him and hug him tightly right now, savoring the warmth she had missed so much.

It was only after she had died that she realized who the good and bad guys really were.

At that moment, Scarface finally came back to his senses, turning around and grabbing her by the neck. Then, he barked sharply, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come over, or I‚Äôll kill her!‚Äù

Lu Yanmu looked at him expressionlessly, without a hint of emotion on his face. His voice dripped with contempt as he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while since I met such hopelessly reckless idiots.‚Äù

Scarface faltered slightly under his gaze, but he forced himself to remain calm. ‚ÄúLu Yanmu, you should‚Äôve known this would happen when you forced us to one dead end after another, leaving us with no other choice. Someone like you would never know our pain!‚Äù

Disgust flashed across Lu Yanmu‚Äôs face as he turned around, straightening his sleeves with a light touch. ‚ÄúSuch nonsense.‚Äù

As soon as he said this, a group of guards flew out from god-knows-where, taking down the thugs as his words echoed through the complex. Even the man who was previously strangling Qingmang had been pinned to the ground and rendered immobile.

Qingmang was a little shocked at the speed of these secret guards. Although she had seen them before in her past life, it still surprised her to see them in action again.

While Qingmang was still frozen in shock, the man walked right past the thugs and eventually stopped in front of her. He looked at her, his eyes cold and dark. His gaze, as deep as a bottomless abyss, gleamed as though they were hiding an underlying danger.

She was sitting on the chair, but when she sensed his gaze, a sudden chill ran up her spine straight into her heart. She shuddered slightly.

Her experience from her past life told her that Lu Yanmu was very angry right now. No, it would be more accurate to say that he was on the verge of exploding. 

Lu Yanmu was extraordinarily possessive. She had snuck away from him, and to make things worse, it was so she could meet Zhao Xiyuan. This had crossed the line, breaking the limits of his otherwise unnatural patience. With the aid of the dim lighting, she could even make out the layer of fury hidden behind Lu Yanmu‚Äôs eyes. 

How should she quell this man‚Äôs rage?

The two of them had a standoff for a long time. However, when Gu Qingmang thought that he was finally about to turn around and leave, the man reached out his hand and pulled off the tape in one sharp movement. The pain made her hiss out loud through gritted teeth.",romance
I've this guy i liked. We dont talk much but ik he's kind and a nice guy. We are graduating high school soon...i wanna confess to him before i never get to see him again but idk how...any tips or advices?,romance
"So. I met this guy at a club in early October. I got his number and we talked for a few days before we met up. I had a good time and I liked him, and we agreed to meet up again. During the week, we didn‚Äôt text much, which is completely fine by me. At some point he asked when we could meet up again and we decided on a week later (cause that week he was travelling). Before he travelled, I texted him ‚Äúhave a safe flight‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt reply, that‚Äôs fine. Two days later, I texted ‚Äúhey how was the UK‚Äù, he didn‚Äôt reply. He didn‚Äôt reply for the entire week. So a day before we were supposed to meet up I asked if we‚Äôre still on for tomorrow. He said yes and was supposed to come to my city. However, the next day (the day he was supposed to come) he texted saying that he‚Äôs sorry and can‚Äôt come. I said sorry to hear that and hope that everything is fine. I didn‚Äôt try contacting him again and he didn‚Äôt either. Not gonna lie, I was disappointed cause I liked him, but I mean if he was interested he would‚Äôve contacted me again or put in some effort. So I got over him. But then today (so 2 months later) he texted ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs been a while‚Äù. No shit man. I replied casually and now the convo is casual.
Why do you guys think he replied 2 months later? How do I deal with is? If he asks to meet up what do I say? Part of me thinks I should just be normal, cause I mean I barely knew the guy. We only met up once and we‚Äôre not close enough for me to have been totally upset about his ghosting. But another part is like, sista if he acted like this before who‚Äôs to say he won‚Äôt again. After all, how a person acts says a lot about their personality. What‚Äôs your take on this?",romance
"Warning this is going to be a long one. And to fully understand something I‚Äôll explain some stuff here.
1. When you win your heat in swimming (8 people) you get a rubber ducky.
2. We are all swimmers.
3. When you go into someone‚Äôs lane you have to stay with them for three hours (all of practice).
4. There are time intervals that you leave on in swimming, the leader of this lane is in charge of when to leave.

I‚Äôve liked this girl for about 4 years and have been friend zoned, she‚Äôs a tan chinese girl who is about 5.9 ft, pretty face and good body, she‚Äôs really social being friends with almost everyone I know. We first met when i was 12, we both swim for the same swim team, when I first met her she was shy but very kind to me, we eventually became friends and nothing happened for like a month, until this guy asks her out (on a date) and she says yes I was watching it as this happened but did nothing, it was at this moment I got really jealous and mad, I never realized it but I guess I liked her. From then on it became a competition between me and Tyler, who could be the nicest to her who would talk the most to her, who‚Äôs lane she went in (it‚Äôs a swimmers thing) who could give the best presents. I started off by getting close to her friends, which was easy because I actually got along with them really well. Then I started coming in her and her friends lane and leading it, this became our close little group of friends I became labeled as the ‚Äúgay guy‚Äù in the group of females. But hey... it worked. Her birthday comes around and I go totally overboard, I give her a cap, with Micheal Phelps, Ryan Lochte, Nathan Adrian, missy franklin and Ariana cougars, and a iTunes gift card, Tyler gives her a Mickey Mouse plush toy.  I get a text from her about how sweet I am you know whatever, nothing really happens for around another year besides me and her hanging out in the group together nothing really happening. Except for Valentine‚Äôs Day, Tyler got her nothing and she gave him a card, we have a swim meet on that weekend, so I win a total of 7 events in one day (one was against Tyler) so what I do is I get the 7 duckies which are all holding big hearts, and I carry them to her and our friends group and just dump them all on her lap. Informs of Tyler and his friends and just walk away. Fast forward to her next birthday, she‚Äôs been dropping hints to Tyler about how she wants some candles form this really really really expensive place, he gents her an mint mouse plush, and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwow... thank you!‚Äù But then I walk into practice with a big basket of her favorite candles and bath bombs and she drops the plush and takes the candles, she‚Äôs so happy, her days made my days made. (Throughout this entire time period she‚Äôs been coming in my lane we have been hanging out with friends and it‚Äôs been good) fast forward to January, I here from one of my guy friends that Tyler‚Äôs planning to breakup with her, what‚Äôs more is he has been cheating on her with Patrick‚Äôs (my close friend) girlfriend. I‚Äôm conflicted I want to tell her but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. So I watch as slowly the rumors leak and he breaks up with her, she is completely fine, like even smiling a bit. But she also stops talking to me, she starts leaving my lane and responds to my texts a lot more rarely now. One month later she leaves my team completely, and from there we basically stop seeing each other. This all happened around March so we come to the summer and I see her at a Swim meet, she hunts she‚Äôs been cooking a lot, and I hint that she should come over sometime. She sends me a text later that says we should hangout during the summer it takes an entire month for us to get together at my house, alone. We decide to go paddle boarding on the lake talk about what‚Äôs happened since she left. We laugh fall into the water a couple times, she of coarse looks amazing in her one piece and braids. We decide to head back and dry off I let her change in my bed room, and then she says I can come in and change and then I make a joke about her to get out because I have to change and she says ‚Äúok, ha I wasn‚Äôt planning on staying‚Äù and then leaves with a smile on her face. I change and walk upstairs where she‚Äôs waiting on the coach, we decide to watch a movie together. We decide on the other women (she choose it)  and after we watch it we decide to make salmon, we cook it together and eat it, not Awful, it‚Äôs 9pm by this time and her mom calls to say she can‚Äôt find my house, so she decides to walk to the main road, I of coarse escort her and wait with her for her mom, I made a joke about something I can‚Äôt remember what, and my crush starts talking about how this old Chinese guy was hitting on her at her brothers wedding, and I of coarse respond with a omg what! That‚Äôs awful I‚Äôd never do that to you, and as a joke and a sort of I‚Äôll defend you thing I asked what his name and where he lived she laughed and said it was fine and she didn‚Äôt know, her mom picks her up and leaves. The last and final meetings I‚Äôve had with her was a week ago, when I asked her out and she responded with a ya! Lets invite Riley, a mutual friend of both of ours. I say ok because I want to hangout and I like Riley. Me and Riley make it there but Allison‚Äôs late, we get to talking and I find out that Allison had asked Riley to come because she felt super awkward with just me and her there, of coarse I‚Äôm really saddened by this because I thought our last hangout went great, but I just answer with a haha ya it would have been awkward, Allison finally arrived at the mall and we go get some food we are all talking happily but I can feel that Allison doesn‚Äôt really feel comfortable talking with me, and when she does it‚Äôs kind of a humiliating tone, mocking me, like when I would say I was going to look up a random persons insta Allison said ‚Äúif you can spell their name‚Äù and other insults like that. At the end of our hangout I get a text from Allison, I open my phone and expect to see a ‚ÄúI had a great time‚Äù or maybe a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do it again‚Äù but just to see her mock me for a comment I‚Äôd made earlier. We haven‚Äôt talked since then and I have no idea what to do, on one hand this girl has kept me up at night, I think about all we could be, how much I love her and that I‚Äôd take a bullet for her. On the other she seems not interested and never gives me much attention, and all she‚Äôs done lately is be mean. I really really love her, but I don‚Äôt know what to do, can you guys help me? Should I stop taking to her, or try something else?",romance

Dear Romance Readers: I am in need of your help in find a the below romance story ...

I was introduced to Gothic Romance genre after visiting a local book resell shop sometime around 1980. However, I did purchase Romance paperbacks such as Harlequin, Silhouette, etc. Unfortunately, I no longer recall the author or the title of this romance story that I am hoping to come across again and hoping that the below info will jog another romance readers memory of the book or provide possible suggestions. During my search for this romance book, I have come across great authors, such as Woodiwiss, Lindsay, Holm, Cookson, etc.

**\*\*\*\*\*\***

**Story Setting:**

* ¬∑ Along a coast and the story references the heroine walks along her estate and neighbors cliffs\*;
* ¬∑ Not sure if story takes place in England or along the eastern coastline of America

**Heroine (virgin age 18 to early 20s)**

* ¬∑ The story starts shortly after the Heroine's father has passed away and she and the staff are expecting a new ""Master"" owner to her families' estate.
* ¬∑ Heroine no longer has any living family members and is at the mercy of the new owner or new Master in this case.
* ¬∑ Heroine does stay on living at her families former estate with the new Master and keeps her same bedroom;
* ¬∑ I believe she is lonely and I believe the story references her seeking solitude in her bedroom.
* ¬∑ I believe she feels useless and of no importance.
* ¬∑ I also believe that the new owner is entertaining\*\* and she either is not part of the parties or she escapes to her bedroom during the parties.
* ¬∑ Takes walks along the back of her families estate and that of the neighbor's home\*;
* ¬∑ A male childhood friend who lives with \[I believe\] his grandfather
* ¬∑ I believe she does find the new Master handsome and may have budding feelings towards him, but the new Master may see her as a child and may even treat her that way.

**Hero (maybe late 20s to mid-30s)**

* ¬∑ Alpha male figure or strong character who knows what he wants;
* ¬∑ I feel as though our hero is referred to as ""Master"" and runs the estate as master of his domain;
* ¬∑ Do not recall how he obtained her families estate (not sure if it is a distant relative or if our hero purchased the estate);
* ¬∑ I believe the hero shows indifference towards our heroine when he first meeting and does find her attractive, but he may feel she is too young for his purposes of a mate. (he may be
* ¬∑ He may be searching for a wife who would fulfill his new status, but not looking for a love match
* ¬∑ I feel as though he was entertaining families who have eligible daughters (or these families were pushing their daughters on him due to his title and status)
* ¬∑ He may be looking for a wife that would fit his new status (good hostess and produce an heir for him)
* ¬∑ I feel that with all the entertaining that he is doing that our Heroine retreats to her room for solitude or she may not be included to partake in the parties he hosts.

**Supporting characters**:

* ¬∑ Grandfather: who lives in the house adjacent to the estate and is an old friend of her family. \[I believe he is survived by his late wife\]
* ¬∑ Your male figure in this story is his grandson\*
* ¬∑ \*Young Male Figure: who is referred to as the Heroine's childhood friend and is either living with his grandfather in this house or visits him often.
* ¬∑ This young man loves our heroine and will confess his feelings to her at some point in the story; however, our heroine does not reciprocate his feelings and thinks of him only as a friend.
* ¬∑ The grandfather and the young man are special to our heroine as her only source of family.
* ¬∑ Estate Housekeeper: may have been with the heroine since her birth and cared for her whole life.

**Little Bits I recall of the Story:**

* ¬∑ I feel as though when our Heroine \[and staff\] met the new ""master/owner"" of her families estate, she greeted him at the top of the stairs to the estate or this may have happened later on in the story when he arrived back home \[not sure\]
* ¬∑ I believe that the male childhood friend of our Heroine does not like the Master and I believe it would be due to the fact that the young man has feelings for her. And the two male figures could have words said between them, as well as the Master making a reference to the heroine about the young man.

**Situation I**

* ¬∑ The master has fallen sick \[not sure of the illness\], but he has a very high fever and I believe the housekeep and/or staff has been taking care of him and they are exhausted;
* ¬∑ This is when our lonely heroine steps in and volunteers to sit through the night with the master (hero) and as the heroine is nursing him \[and may have reached over him\] as he laid on the bed in his fever state, he reaches up and grabs her and pins heroine on the bed underneath him and proceeds to ""make love"" to her. \[I am sure our heroine tries to free herself but to no avail\] and the master (hero) takes her virginity.
* ¬∑ I believe it started out as a rape for the heroine, but I believe she savors this opportunity of discovering passion from a man \[or even this man as she has feelings for him\] as a result, this act ends up being a very heated encounter between the two.
* ¬∑ The next morning, as I recall, the housekeeper is at the master's room in order to take over the vigil. I do not believe that the young woman says anything to the housekeeper or any of the staff about the sex scene that had occurred during his vigil with the master and she may have even cleared away any evidence of her losing her virginity to him.
* ¬∑ However, not completely certain if she had and he may have discovered the evidence when he recovered from his illness (fever state).
* ¬∑ I do recall that the master kept asking if the housekeeper/staff if there had been a woman in his room during his illness (fever state) and was told that there was not anyone other them the staff and the heroine.
* ¬∑ I wish I could recall if the hero did have a woman he was dating or a potential wife, as he would have been asking if she had been in his room \[someone other than a virgin\] as I do not believe that he lets himself believe at this point in the story that it would have been our heroine in his bed that night.
* ¬∑ However, when the hero does recover from his illness, he is troubled by nagging thoughts that what had happened that night with our Heroine; however, he doesn't know that it was her \[at this point in the story\] was not just a ""vivid"" dream, but it had to have really occurred.
* ¬∑ As a result, he is trying to find out who had been in his room that night in order to find this woman;
* ¬∑ He is told that no one other than servants and heroine had cared for him.
* ¬∑ He may be seeing someone in this story; however, I do not recall
* ¬∑ I feel as though he dismisses the thought that it would have been our heroine that had shared his bed that night.
* ¬∑ At some point in the story, the Hero does find out that it was our Heroine who was in his bed that night during his fevered state.

**Situation II**

* ¬∑ Not sure why our heroine ran away from the master (estate), but the heroine goes to the home of the young man/grandfather.
* ¬∑ It may have been due to a scheming woman who has designs on the master and wants our heroine out of the way and said something to our heroine to make her run off. \[such as, that the young woman is expecting a marriage offer and will make the Heroine's live hell\]
* ¬∑ While the Heroine is staying at this home, the young man declares his feelings towards her and may even ask her to marry. I believe she does tell him that she does not love him, but may agree to marry him in order to have safety and a purpose in her life ‚Äì care for his grandfather. \[the grandfather suspects that she does not feel the same towards his grandson\]
* ¬∑ Hero does seek her at the grandfather's home \[not sure what how he felt after she had ran off and if he just shrugged it off or if he ended up learning something from a scheming other woman vuing for his attention and marriage\] I believe our hero is developing stronger feelings for our heroine and goes to talk to her.
* ¬∑ Heroine does talk to the hero but not certain if she tells him at this time that she is attending to marry the young man.
* ¬∑ I believe that our hero does tell her that if she returns to the estate that she will be given importance to the estate and that could be the running of the estate. \[I do not believe that he knows that it was her in his bed ‚Äì but he does want her back at the estate\]
* ¬∑ I feel as though the grandfather was in a next room and heard the conversation between the hero and heroine and may have heard the tender feelings she has for this man in her voice. At any rate, I do believe that the heroine seeks the grandfather's council and I believe it is him that persuades her to return to the estate with our hero. \[she does tell the grandson/young man that she will not be marrying him and that she is returning to the estate\]

**Situation III**

* ¬∑ The Heroine does return back to the estate and I feel as though the she is pregnant. \[I do not know if she tells anyone or if the housekeeper finds evidence that the heroine was the woman in the bed\]
* ¬∑ I do recall a scene where the heroine is in the dining room and maybe going through the estates china for cleaning or for getting ready for a dinner, but the hero does seek her in this room and confronts her as I believe at this point the hero knows that it was our heroine that was the woman in his bed. \[do not recall how he finds out, but he does\]
* ¬∑ I feel as though it is during this dining room scene that the Hero declares his feelings for the Heroine and she does the same towards him. \[I believe he asks her to marry him and she accepts his proposal. I believe this is how the story ends\]",romance

"... I didn't like running to catch my train, but if I would have walked as casually as I do I would have missed it and I'd have to wait half an hour for the next to train to arrive.

I spurted, didn't take the escalator, people would be standing left and right there anyway. Heading straight towards the stairs, I took two steps at a time, overtaking casual other commuters.

Finally, trying to catch my breathe, I reached the train station upstairs, thankfully my train didn't arrive yet, I still had like 2 minutes on the clock. As I was walking along the station, figuring out if I want to sit in the front or back side of the train I spotted a woman. She had brown long jacket and stylish handbags, I think it was one of those designer handbags, probably the expensive ones. Since as a male I don't have much experience with handbags, I could only guess. I look at her, she had long blonde-brunette-ish hair, she looked in my direction as well. I realized that I actually know her. Yes, it was her, it must be her! The girl I knew from school. It's been so long. I smiled instantly as I was looking in her direction.

I was so confused, couldn't believe that it was her, I stood awkwardly there, as I saw almost no reaction from her side, at best a surprise, I was frozen. I turned a bit so that I wasn' t facing her directly... my thoughts running, desperately trying to figure out if it is really her and how I could approach her.

As I was standing there trying to figure out a way to talk to her and elderly woman probably asked her a question, she answered her and moved towards the stairs and went down.

I was frozen, shocked, surprised.... and confused.

I decided to talk to her, I went downstairs as well but I couldn't see her anywhere.

I wanted to talk to her so much, would have liked to know what she is doing nowadays and how she is... I think it would have been nice....

I decided to run into the McDonald's nearby maybe she was buying something there while waiting for her next train... she was nowhere to be found.

I was sad, and probably looked crazy for the other people around me. I walked upstairs again, my train arrived and I went home, thinking about her and wishing to have taken initiative.

What could have happened? If she doesn't like me anymore she could have let me know and I'd let her be..... there I am left with my thoughts.... with my thoughts about her.

In a last attempt I walked through the whole train in the hope of meeting her. I didn't found her. As I came closer to my final destination I was getting mad at myself for not taking the initiative, for being a coward, for being so awkward, ughhhh!

As I turned my head one last time, I spotted someone else, my mood instantly switched. Although we talked for like 30 seconds it was quite pleasant, I hope it was pleasant for her too, at least she said so, I wish I meet her again.",romance

"So I‚Äôm an eighth grade middle schooler and I like someone in my grade. She‚Äôs nice, funny, and honestly really nice to talk to. There are a few signs that she likes me, but otherwise I‚Äôm not very sure.  We talk almost every night over snapchat and sometimes instagram, she holds me in high regard, and we talk a bit at school.  I‚Äôm almost sure that I am in the friendzone though.

"When ignorance wasn‚Äôt bliss. 

      5th grade- I wasn‚Äôt a cute kid. Not ugly per say, but ordinary. I remember the twenty minute walk home from the train, with my face in a book. My little brothers bickered ahead of me. I drove through stinging nettle patches on my bike with my them. We climbed trees... you get it. Late bloomer. I didn‚Äôt notice that I wasn‚Äôt unnoticed, and therefore I was unaware. Ignorance is bliss right? Maybe in this case, perhaps not. 
I had always little crushes on guys for as long as I can remember. I was sheltered, and naive, however. Nothing came of anything...

      That is until the new guy came to my little private school. Not just any dude. Imagine a non sociopathic version of Zack Morris from Saved By the Bell. Even better- imagine Leo from Titanic, minus the whole dying thing. Just the first tape...He was dreamy. He was witty, charismatic, best of all, a wonderful artist. He was a cool middle school kid, as I was just a 5th grader. He was in 7th grade. He had dirty blonde hair, blue eyes and a brilliant smile. He was Julian. I‚Äôd sneak through his files in art class. My hands would shake, and I‚Äôd stare in awe at his work. He was perfect. 

      I noticed that after school, he didn‚Äôt typically take the underground like everyone else had. He walked another way, and would then disappear. I had to find out where he was going. It was my little twelve year old dream that he would walk with me there, to the train, (or his secret place) and hold my hand. I hatched a plan. My then only real friend outside of school was recruited to stalk this kid with me, along with my youngest brother. It‚Äôs oddly easy to follow someone in a city. It is smarter to do so when familiar with the area. 

      He, and his friends turned a corner, as we followed from a distance. Naturally, my heart pounded. We giggled and speculated all the secret things he could‚Äôve been doing. There was a brick arch way that turned into a small flowery court yard. I peered around it, and saw him smoking a cigarette... ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs his little secret,‚Äô I thought. My naive brain was rattled. Not that he smoked, but that his older brother noticed me. The whole group, including Julian, saw me. There was no point in hiding, and no way of being able to casually pass through the court yard. It was a dead end. 

      ‚ÄúHey Nicole,‚Äù he said, slightly confused. Still friendly, and so charming. 

Nicole Autopilot:

      ‚ÄúHey Julian... you know, it‚Äôs crazy- my brother ran away...and I was just looking for him.‚Äù  The embarrassment radiated through me- like it had been injected directly through my veins.

      ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that your brother right there?‚Äù Julian nodded knowingly towards him- My brother stared blankly... 

‚ÄúYes, yes...that‚Äôs him, I‚Äôve found him.‚Äù 

      I wrote all about the hilarity, and humiliation in my diary that night. My head spun. ‚ÄòNow he knows I like him-so screwed.‚Äô 





Part 2 - One year goes by- 

      Sixth grade rolled around, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to see him again. I even pondered about him in my diary that hot, un-air-conditioned summer. When school started, I walked by him, standing coolly with his friends. Our eyes locked, it hurt to look at him. I walked on- he watched me pass by. I could hardly feel my legs carry me.

Nicole autopilot. 

      During school enrollment period, was the first time I ever saw him. I remember how he walked, I couldn‚Äôt believe this gorgeous Austrian boy I had witnessed. I couldn‚Äôt look back up at him. It seared my blown eye sockets when his eyes met mine. I could smell him as he breezed by. My ears went hot. I outed the idea of him quickly. The school was small. ‚ÄòEvery girl will be all over him,‚Äô I thought. I just knew there would be no way. I was very right. Girls would gush about him, not only at school, but to my own 13th birthday party. I went with a lot of girls from school to paddle boat on the Danube river. They wouldn‚Äôt have spoken to me, had there not been an occasion to do something. Plus, I was allowed out of the house. Teen goals... 

      We laughed on the water. Topic Julian came up, and I froze. It was another American girl much more developed, and less naive than I. Molly, along with several others admitted to liking him. They spoke of all their magical encounters with him. I sat there paralyzed. In the autumn Austrian sun, I played it off until the fan-girling fest was over. I cringed every time his name came up, unless it was one of the hundred times I‚Äôd written about him in my diary. I didn‚Äôt know how to take this infatuation of mine. 


      This year was different. I started wearing lipstick and mascara. My body changed from lanky to shapely/slender. In my mind, I was still just a kid, but hormones were kicking in quickly. Boys called out to me in the city. Love notes, and poems came my way. Still a total nervous, dorky mess in my mind. The attention took me by surprise.

      I remember the first time Julian spoke to me. He made me laugh, but so insanely nervous. ‚ÄòSurely, he‚Äôs fucking with me,‚Äô I thought. I started seeing him more, and I would look forward to passing him in the hall after art class. ‚ÄúHey Nicole!‚Äù He said. Being the stubborn ass that I was, I walked on. He was never short of female attention, why me? 

      My International private school separated boys and girls physical ed. Our school didn‚Äôt have a gymnasium. The rented fields were a good 15 Minute walk away. This was a rare time in which we weren‚Äôt supervised. The walks to and from the field was everyone‚Äôs fun time to talk about whatever we wanted. I should say whatever ‚Äòthey‚Äô wanted, because sometimes, I‚Äôd walk with my one friend. I commonly walked alone. 

      Julian caught up to me from these walks. We would talk about where we were from, and whatever else. It shook me completely. He was 2 years older than myself, and clearly less naive. He would slide his finger over the back of my bra. Putting on my act, mixed with being paralyzed, 

Autopilot 

      I rolled my eyes. I couldn‚Äôt believe he was paying attention to me. He was a funny guy, and I was still awkward and weird. I still had to show him I wasn‚Äôt like the rest of his fan club. I secretly savored every bit of his attention. He was just so cool. Too cool for me. Not just conventionally cool. Savvy, confident, and ingenious. Our last phys-ed walk that I remember, he held my hand. It was a truly beautiful walk. Just like a movie, my dream came true. He held my trembling hand. I worried he‚Äôd noticed. My life long bully followed behind, hitting me in the ankles with a hockey stick. I didn‚Äôt feel it. Julian held my hand. 

      I still never let on. I basically secretly played our interactions in my head over, and over. I fantasized about him in any way that my pre pubescent mind could. He gave me a reason not to hate school. I had few friends, and didn‚Äôt do well in general. 

      He was so smooth. It was time for phys ed, and I headed down the large, old stair case towards the exit. I smelled him behind me. Only God in Heaven knows what scent he wore, because I swear, that‚Äôs where it came from. Before I could fall down the stairs, (simply from the mini panic attack of his presence) I felt a light touch on my shoulder. From behind me, he moved his hands in a way from my neck down to my ankles, mimicking an hour glass, hardly touching me. Kid had moves... I continued down the stairs, clinging to the old railing for dear life.

      I once left my diary (full of his name) at his bus stop. In horror, I grabbed my little brother‚Äôs hand, jumped off the metro, and sprinted back. I cried, and just knew he‚Äôd find it. Somehow, I found it where I‚Äôd left it. There, in it‚Äôs floral pattern, it sat neatly on a wooden bench seemingly untouched. Interestingly, being at his bus stop was the only attempt I‚Äôd ever made to approach him. Not out of spite, but when I finally had the nerve- he was never there. 

      Toward the middle of the year, there was talk of certain Austrian students having to leave the private school. My heart sunk. It was true after all. It turned out to be a technicality of accreditation. Julian came to school less and less. I still didn‚Äôt have what it took to hide my grief. I rarely spotted him after school, but the last day he attended. I was on my usual way to the subway when he caught up with me. My friends walked ahead, the path was narrow. Before I could get the nerve to ask him if I‚Äôd ever see him again, I completely ruined it. 

      Julian slowly moved his body towards mine, as we were pressed against an old brick wall. I‚Äôll never forget how close he was to me- I‚Äôd never been close to any man like that. My ears rung, and I was on fire. I remember the cold brick on my back, and his scent. Fire and ice surged throughout me. I looked down, and nervously laughed. When I looked up, he went to kiss me. To this day, I‚Äôll never know why, but I slapped him. He immediately walked ahead with everyone else, and wouldn‚Äôt look at me. It was as though it‚Äôd all happened in less than a second. I didn‚Äôt know he was kissing me. I didn‚Äôt have the time to process what had just happened. Before I could apologize, his train came, and I never saw him again. Sort of...

      Some time later, perhaps a year or even more, my school held an event. He was long gone. Never from my mind, but it had been some time since his departure. I suppose we‚Äôd grown up a lot. I didn‚Äôt know he was there, until the event was over. The school gossip informed me that he was outside. Unsure why to this day, but my only reaction was ‚Äòwhy.‚Äô I couldn‚Äôt stop wondering why he attended, while I face checked myself before seeing him.  The cold Austrian chill jacked me in the face, as most days, and my hair flew back as I exited the building to ‚Äòleave,‚Äô (aka see him.) This would be my last chance, and I knew it. Then, there he was, cool as ever. He wasn‚Äôt animated though, I couldn‚Äôt say hello. His demeanor was different. It was defeated. Maybe perhaps even resentful. I‚Äôd slapped him after all. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôd assumed that he‚Äôd conveniently forget about the whole, slapping thing. I‚Äôll always wonder why he‚Äôd looked solemn that night. I didn‚Äôt think it was because of me. I wondered a lot about everything, but specifically him. The first guy that ever noticed me. I remember so much, that I‚Äôve become accustomed to people not remembering what I remember. It was charming. Sad, but charming. Just like the very last time I saw him. I‚Äôve always felt in tune with other‚Äôs feelings. It took a lot of years to truly process what happened; to this day, I still wonder. I nonchalantly waved at a distance, as I made my way to the tram. He watched coldly as I disappeared from the corner to the tram. 

I was 16, school friend and I were flipping through Maxim mag on the subway. I stumbled across an Axe ad. 

 ‚ÄúThis could be Julian,‚Äù I laughed at my horrid eyesight. Haley snatched my copy.

‚ÄúThat is Julian.‚Äù 

He is now a brilliant artist in his field.

"Autoromanticism -the most LITERAL self love- can feel partly dismal when it's born of as profound an isolation as I know, but I spend a while in here, and I begin to learn of it's unique perks: Effortless and instant communication, I appreciate things more when I appreciate myself appreciating them(as is seen in ANY romantic relationship), less suspicion, I now have this powerful DRIVE to do better for myself(someone within who FIGHTS for me), I know my lover MUCH more than I normally could(FUCK... &lt;3), I experience that poetic irony wherein the ONE I was looking for was here the whole time, I get to enjoy my favorite aspect of SEXCAPADES more often(emotional, oh my GOD...), more AGREEMENTS :P, romantic moments can easily be private, the combo of way less squabbles and far more shared experiences can make such a unique relationship feel most POWERFUL, etc, etc...",romance
"*(metaphorically)*

We've been dating about 2 years now, and when we started, I was a depressed mess on the tail end of a decade-long struggle with self hatred. I gave up on all my life's dreams because I did poorly in school, dropped out of university, and didn't like my appearance in general.  I'd mostly bottled up my feelings but one day, when I was having a particularly rough few days, he saw the writing on the wall and talked me down from it. I was immediately blown away by how caring and sweet he was, his mannerisms were so genuine and I desperately wanted to hug him within only an hour of chatting.

After about 2 months, we started flirting and it sort of all just developed from there. He slowly gave me my confidence back, I started working again and within a year considered going back to uni and giving it a serious try this time. He told me that no matter what happens, he'll always stay by my side, even in times of insecurity. I usually go into relationships believing that both parties should work hard to ensure that they're life long, and I'm so happy that I finally met someone who believes that too! For the first time in my adult life, I'm happy, and it's all thanks to him. To say I love him is an understatement, I think he's my soulmate. After years of shitty bfs I think he's finally the one!!! I love everything about him, he's smart (denies it), handsome (denies it), strong willed, empathetic, and most of all committed.

I love when it rains at night, it makes it easier to sleep and stuff, but it can't even compare to his voice! Over the years I've drifted off to the sound of his voice many times, and had the best nights of my life as a result.

I love him unconditionally and unwaveringly. We've argued a few times, but always been able to bounce back, and even if I get frustrated with him, I never want to leave. Not now, not ever. I want to be the last thing on his mind before he goes to sleep, like he is for me. For the rest of our lives.

(I'm sorry, I just had to let it all out, he's sleeping and I don't want to wake him up ;-;)",romance
"As a kid I had a best friend we would hangout all the time. As we grew up naturally we grew apart but we've always been friendly. In the 10th grade he moved schools and we lost touch completely.

He was my first love, of course since then I had many crushes but this is the person that Alicia Keys and Usher would describe as ""their boo"". He has a special place in my heart. He is a shy person by nature and I am a loud mouthed and we kinda balance each other out.

I graduated high school and moved away for 7 years. When I  moved back home last year, we reunited. I approached him at a party and we talked. The feelings came rushing back on a full force. When I say full force I mean full force. He was the same yet matured, his personality had matured so much. Yet that child like charm remained. In our first meeting I was calm I was able to talk and make conversation. But when I went home and I revisited my feelings and I came to the realization of what had occurred.

Which caused our second meeting to be much of an awkward exchange, he approached me and caught me off guard, the music was too loud for me to actually notice him approaching me and that ruined everything. My heart was beating too hard for my head to hear what he was saying and I basically could not control the way I was acting and it turned out well in simple terms awkward. Even my friend who was with me at the time had mentioned that I acted in a weird way.

Since then he has not reached out and neither have I.... But I cannot get him out of my head. and the lady luck has not been on our side so we have not met in a coincidence since. I usually can read him well but the last meeting I was too nervous to read his vibe.

Although I ran into his family and they mentioned that he had told them that we met again and he was happy that we met again...

What should I do? Should I approach or should I ignore these feelings...  I feel lost. I wanna know whether to move on with my life or actually go for what my heart wants even though I might get hurt and lose a life long friend.",romance

"WARNING - LONG POST

So my very significant other (also male) wants me to fulfil my promise of living next to him. 

The only problem is he's now married.

And yes, we have ~~already slept several times~~ a history together.

We were best friends and roommates when we were in uni. He was in Engineering and I was in Business Ad so we never had classes together, but apart from classes we were pretty much together every time. We were also very physical, you know, like holding hands, hugging, and stuff, which, frankly, are not unusual in this side of the planet. I mean they're not automatically signs of gayness. It was for me, but I was never sure if it was the same for him. 

I mean I liked him more than just a bro from the onset but I never really had the courage to confess to him nor to ask him about it. Although people like us enjoy a much more tolerating society compared to other Asian countries, it's still some sort of an unspoken taboo and most parents would tend to force their children to hide their non-heterosexuality.

Fast forward to our final year in school, he had  a girlfriend. As expected, the girlfriend was the overly jealous type and would complain about the amount of time V.S.O. and I would spend together. She would even read our chats in between classes and would sometimes confront me about why V.S.O. would say he loves me, or that his mom wants to cook dinner for me the coming weekend. It got to a point where she would call me and beg me to give V.S.O and her some time to spend together and I would always say yes to it, despite my broken heart. 

They got into a fight for some unknown reason and the next thing I know, she had one of her guy friends who also live in our dorm to take a picture of myself and V.S.O. cuddling while asleep I think you can guess what happened after that.

V.S.O. being the coward that he was, went on academic leave and flew to Canada to study English. I was left alone to handle the disaster of being outed to the whole school who felt like it was their business to know who I was sleeping with. 

It was hell walking through corridors and literally everyone in the cafeteria would stay away from the table where I would eat and they would whisper / talk about me being the gay dude who spread my gayness and converted someone's boyfriend / made someone queer...as if that's remotely possible!

&amp;#x200B;

It was too much and I contemplated suicide but luckily I found a job and my professors agreed to let me work, it was my final semester anyway, and I was only left with a handful of general education courses -- no major ones. They gave me D's and C's, but it was okay. At least I got out of school and successfully graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

I deleted my Facebook account and changed numbers and didn't have contact with him until after 2 years when we accidentally met in the subway near H.Y. university and I tried to run away from him but he ended up chasing me and we hugged and all the bad memories came back and I just cried and cried and cried.

We ended up having sex, for the first time, that night. It was amazing, probably because it felt like a confirmation that my feelings were actually reciprocated and that I didn't imagine all the memories I have of him.

This went on for a few months, I also had a boyfriend then, who I broke up with, FOR HIM!!!

Then he told me that his company decided to send him to the U.S. for a 5 year project (He works for a big car company) and that I should quit my job and join him there. I work for a big group of companies, though not as big as his, and I simply can't quit my job and blindly follow him to the U.S., right? 

So I decided against it and I don't know why but after that, I was never able to find a relationship that lasted for more than a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from him 7 months later that he's coming home to get married and that he wanted me to be the best man. I was so offended by this that I cut contact with him again.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only this month that we established contact once again. We've had video call on Facebook for the longeeeest time and he was trying to convince me to come and join him again. He reminded me of our promise to live next to each other as we grow old. He said he still loves me and he wants to be with me. I believe that. But the problem is, he's married! I'm sure the wife doesn't even know about this side of him! I know that this is morally wrong so I really can't bring myself to say yes to him.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, however, I don't think I'll ever be able to find another significant other...

I feel like I should not be choosy and just accept this chance at being happy, even if it comes with a sh\*tty set of terms and conditions... what do you guys think? #HELPME",romance

Chapter 1 So Ugly

Mu Nuannuan sat in front of the vanity mirror, waiting for her makeup artist, but her mind was somewhere else.

The door swung open and Xiao Chuhe dashed in. Seeing that Mu Nuannuan was still roosting there in a dull cotton jacket and her hair was akin to a scarecrow, she chided, ‚ÄúPeople from the Moo Family have arrived. Why haven‚Äôt you gotten changed?‚Äù

Mu Nuannuan pushed her black-framed glasses back up her nose, her droopy eyes making her look as dumb as she could get. ‚ÄúMom, do you really want me to marry elder sis‚Äô fianc√©?‚Äù

Thinking that she was flaking on her, Xiao Chuhe freaked out.

The escort from the Moo Family was already waiting outside. The slightest mistake could ruin the entire Mu family. She was desperate. Dropping to her knees in front of Mu Nuannuan, Xiao Chuhe quavered, ‚ÄúNuannuan, I beg you! Your elder sister deserves better. Help her, please!‚Äù

Mu Nuannuan‚Äôs vacant expression became even colder. Xiao Chuhe, her biological mother devoted all of her attention to her stepchildren, whose mother had died. She even asked Mu Nuannuan to take her sister‚Äôs place to marry an ugly and impotent man.

‚ÄúMadam, Young Mistress, the Moo Family‚Äôs escort is coming up,‚Äù a maid said outside the door.

Mu Nuannuan did not help Xiao Chuhe up. ‚ÄúGet up. I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù

She was completely fed up.

When the door opened, she saw a group of bodyguards standing outside. That was all the Moo Family had sent to collect her. There was no wedding ceremony, no bridegroom. Yet, it was her wedding day.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù She led the way downstairs.

The Moo Family was the wealthiest in the city of Huyang. The family‚Äôs heir, Moo Tingxiao had been kidnapped more than a decade ago. He was also allegedly disfigured and had erectile dysfunction. Since the kidnapping, he had never appeared in public. They said that Moo Tingxiao was savage and ugly, that every woman who entered his house would come out dead.

But even if Moo Tingxiao was a devil, Mu Nuannuan could not have cared less.

...

Arriving at Moo Tingxiao‚Äôs mansion, the bodyguards brought Mu Nuannuan into her room and left. It was not until nightfall that someone pushed open the door.

Mu Nuannuan looked back. A tall man walked in, closed the door behind him, and switched on the light.

She instinctively covered her eyes. Shortly after, she looked up at the man and was transfixed, not because he had a godforsaken face, but because she did not expect him to be so handsome.

The man was muscular and wearing a dark suit. He had long legs, which allowed him to come up to her in just a few strides. His sharp facial features made him look like a piece of art, almost flawless, but also very imposing.

Moo Tingxiao examined Mu Nuannuan for a while and frowned. ‚ÄúSo ugly,‚Äù he said. His tone of voice was somber, almost cold.

Mu Nuannuan snapped out of her daze. She did not care that he called her ugly. Instead, she looked at him cautiously. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

Looking at her with a pair of piercing eyes, Moo Tingxiao asked back, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know who you‚Äôre marrying?‚Äù 

As he got closer, Mu Nuannuan shuddered. His powerful persona was suffocating, but she forced herself to sit tight and upright. ‚ÄúOf course, I know. It‚Äôs Moo Tingxiao!‚Äù

Hearing her answer, Moo Tingxiao seemingly understood; she was just another woman who believed in the rumors. However, that was not the usual reaction of someone marrying an ugly and impotent man. She was just too calm, so much as that he started to find her interesting.

He quirked a smile, pretending to be flirty. ‚ÄúOh, I see. I‚Äôm Moo Jiachen, Moo Tingxiao‚Äôs cousin. I guess you don‚Äôt want to be alone waiting for the cripple on your wedding night, do you?‚Äù",romance

"So warning in advance this is gonna be really pathetic and soppy and saccharin and whatever else, but I guess that's nothing new to this subreddit!

So I'm in no way a 'romantic' person. I'm in a relationship with a girl I met in high school, we recently had our 4 year anniversary and I love her to bits. We barely argue, we make each other laugh, we live together and everything's great, but we're definitely one of those couples who don't show PDA, and who on a night, instead of snuggling up and having cute chats and stuff we'd be more likely to smoke a joint and watch some Netflix comedy.

I've never considered myself romantic like I said, but that's why I need help with this next bit.

We just recently moved into a block of flats, and I swear to god this is going to sound like it's from a Richard Curtis movie but it's honestly true. \*deep breath\* ... I spoke to a girl on my floor for probably 30 seconds as we were waiting for the lift, and I think I'm in love with her.

All I know is that I saw her smile and something inside me went off (not that!). I feel like I need to tell someone, so here I am. I can't tell my long-term girlfriend I'm infatuated with someone else, least of all someone I don't even know and who lives down the hall from us.

Does this make me a bad person? Is this a sign my relationship isn't working? I've always considered myself to be happy and we have a healthy relationship like I said. We don't argue, sex life is good etc. But what I feel for this girl I have not felt for my girlfriend (nor for anyone ever). It literally was like love at first sight, an insane notion as far as I've always been concerned but I guess ultimately it's just chemicals in the brain right?

In the morning I hope I bump into her again (I haven't yet) and I saw her leave the flat with some guy the other day (her boyfriend I presume) and it crushed me. How? I don't even know her! All I know is this better pass, because I can't be in an honest committed relationship when I feel like this for another girl.

Please someone tell me you've experienced something similar and it'll pass, or that I'm not crazy. WHAT IS THIS? What should I do? I tell my girlfriend everything but I can't tell her this. Please give me some kind of advice! Thanks.",romance

"I don't have to squish my eyes as the sun seems to shine straight into them. Ahead of me there is a seemingly endless field of the healthiest green grass I had ever seen. Some of the straws shine brightly, as if it rained slightly before. I reach down, but I feel no wetness on my fingers.

Suddenly, I realize that someone is holding my hand. I turn my head around and see her. Our eyes meet. The sunrays are warming up my side. The more I look at her the more I feel like I am about to melt. Without any words spoken, we start walking. Feeling the grass under our bare feet and inbetween our toes. It's a slightly ticklish feeling, yet their softness makes it very comfortable to walk through them. 

We reach a quite warm area and stop there. I turn around, facing her with my while body. She smiles and turns around as well. We reach for each others free hand. Our eyes are locked onto each other. I feel excited yet nervous and anxious. This is more than I expected and more than I can handle. I feel how my eyes fill up with tears. Tears of joy. I try to keep my smile up in the hope that she understands, that I am actually enjoying this. My heart seems to pound faster with each beat.

She let's go of my hands, they slip back to my side. I stay there, unable to say a word. She just stands there, looking into my eyes with a slight smile. Slowly yet determined she walks closer to me, lifting her hands up and forming them into a cup... I close my eyes... my eyes still being closed I feel her warm hands cupping my face.

I open my eyes, she stands right infront of me, our lips almost touching. Although it's warm and I am melting infront her, my body seems frozen, unable to move. A tear breaks out and runs down my cheek. I blink. Another tear runs down my other cheek.

Our eyes still locked onto each other.

"Right to start things off, I'm a boy that's just recently turned 15 and for the longest time now I've been feeling really lonely. I often think to myself how nice it would be to hold hands with a girl and walk through a forest or a park. I also think about how nice it would feel to hug a girl tightly. 

I want a girlfriend but at the same time I don't as most girls my age are unpleasant to be around. I also go to an all boys school, so that's a problem. I think of going to an all boys school as a good thing and a bad thing because I can't talk to girls at all. But I think it's also a good thing because I'm scared all the girls and boys that are complete assholes will make fun of me. I really don't what to do. I'm conflicted. 

There is a girl called Becky I see every now and then because her school is close to mine. (She goes to an all girls school btw) and she's really cute and nice and I'd really want to get to know her more but everytime I see her, the only thing I can do is say ""Hi"" like the awkward idiot I am. I think about her sometimes and I even fantasised about us being married once. 

I'm not trying toot my own horn but I think I'd make a good boyfriend. I'm willing to her 100% of the time, even when she's being an idiot. I'm willing to give her space if she needs it. I'm willing to treat her like a princess and do a fuck ton of other things. I'm not just talking about becky btw. But this will likely never be the case. I'll probably never find anyone. I have low self esteem, I'm chubby, annoying, unapproachable, stupid and plenty of other things. 

I really need help. As you can clearly see by this post, I'm not good at communicating with anyone. Any solutions on how to fix my loneliness? Any help would be appreciated.

UPDATE: 17th March - thank you to anyone who has responded to me so far. I've read every response but haven't replied to them all as I'm kind of awkward and don't want to repeat myself because then it looks like I'm not really being grateful.

"So there's a girl. I have liked her for maybe two years, I'd say. I always hid it. But recently, I've showed it more. I try to express myself towards her. Most of my mutuals understand my situation.  She's perfect. I've never felt better than when I'm around her. I've never believed in anyone like her before. I think she might like me. Too early to tell. My problem is that I actually like her so much that when I'm around her, I just don't know what to say. I'm not usually that guy. I catch myself staring. She makes my heart swell. I just don't know what to say to her.

Another problem is that there's this guy I hate. The only person I genuinely hate in the world. He hates me too but the difference is I have plenty of reasons to dislike him and he has none towards me. This isn't me being all high-and-mighty, he actually said this to me when I asked him why he doesn't like me. Anyway, I noticed them talking in the hallway recently. It kind of hurt me. She deserves better. But I thought, hey, her life, maybe they're just friends? I thought we were doing well. Time goes on, and I find out they like each other. Demolishes me. He would have treated her like trash. He would have been nice at first and then continued to play with her feelings. That's the kind of guy he is. He uses people for personal gain. I talked this out with a close friend of hers and he talked to her and they split. He said friends are more important than relationships. She was extremely upset, and I felt horrible for her. I hope she's okay now. It's been a couple weeks. We've grown a bit closer again, but sometimes I wonder if she likes me like I like her, or if she still likes the other guy. Doesn't matter much to me. Yeah, it'd upset me, but as long as she's happy. I would be content just being friends with her. I wonder if she likes roses.",romance
"Hi guys, 
I think I could need your help. Sorry if my English is not so on point sometimes. So the thing is some weeks ago I met a really nice girl and we are texting since then. And when there wouldn't be Corona we also would have had our fist date. Since this is not possible right now and I don't know for how long it won't be possible I thought of organising some kind of ""online date"" for her. My only ideas are: 
- sending her a letter in which I ask if she wants a online date with me (hopefully yes)
- then we would facetime and I would order pizza to her place and my place (I won't tell her that before) so it's some kind of candlelight dinner
- and I thought about playing a song on guitar for her which she really likes

Do you have any more ideas for me maybe? I'm not so happy with the ones I got. Thanks in advance and stay healthy guys :)",romance

"So incase you've read what I wrote a week or two ago, here's the rest if the story that is sure to continue. 

So last Friday Night as those of you who read the story I wrote know, I hangout with my crush a second time and wasn't sure if it was a date or a hangout with friends. This past friday night I invited him to come towards the end of my shift at the face painting place, and he did. (I painted a flame and a pair of red lips on his handsü§≠). Anyhow my shift ends and we go to the bleachers (this was a football scrimmage) to sit with his friends. We had a little fun, but then we just ended up facing eachother talking rather than talking with the group of friends. Then he suggested we go get snow cones, we go and this time I wasn't even prepared to pay for myself. Anywho, his friends ditched the game. And I suggested we go to the visitor's side cause I've always wanted to do that for some reason. On the way this old man stops us and asks me ""did he buy that snow cone for you?"" I was like ""yes"" and he was like ""that's what we old people call a date, that is unless he is your older brother"" I jokingly reply ""yep he's my brother"" and put my hand on his bicep. After that I was like ""he's not wrong you know, traditionally that would be a date"". Anywho we go to the other stands and this special ed girl joins us, I was happy to have her there at first but then things started getting awkward. I was so paranoid she could tell something was going on between us. Then she got upset cause she thought I didn't like her, which she tells Micheal after I walk away when she was trying to tell M that she thought this. He walks up to me and was like ""do you hate her?"" (In a totally insincere way cause he knew I didn't) so I go talk to her and decide to tell her no I don't hate her but yes I do want time alone with him cause I like him. So skip forward we all go back to the bleachers towards the top, and she acted so weird and kept winking at me. After some silence she's like I'm gonna go then whispers to me encouraging me to just tell him, he gets curious about what we were talking about. Then asks what was going on, and she gets all flustered and blurts out that she want me to tell him that SHE likes him and i tried really hard to cover it up and play it cool. But he saw through it and asks her to give us a second alone. And she was devastated because of what she had just done (and leaves). He scoots down next to me and was like ""Soo, are you gonna tell me what that was all about"". By that time I was curled up into a ball watching the game. My stomach was being tied in knots every which way. I gave him the *just a sec finger, as I decided what I wanted to do. Then I was like, ""she was trying to get me to tell you the obvious"". To which after about 1 second he replied ""I like you E"". I just looked at him and had one of those smiles that you can't stop no matter what you do. ""I was like, I was scared you wouldn't get what I meant by that"". He got all scared and was like ""did i get it wrong?"". I just said ""no, no you got it right. I like you."" And it was so cute because after that he said ""I like you too."" A second time. After that he walked me home and on the way he said ""So I like you and you like me, what happens next?"" I told him several times it was up to him. 
A cute little after story was on the way home I was like ""you remember when you sang in front of me then asked me to sing too and I was like 'I don't sing in front of people, you are in drama and are used to it' I don't sing, I rap."" The look on his face was priceless, I think it was one of those oh yea she's hot moments. And continue walking. He was like ""no uh uh, you don't get to just say something like that a walk away. Rap.""  I had been preparing to tell him this and show him so, but I got really scared. And then after me continuing walking he was like ""you can't go home yet, I still have your chair"" I ended up doing it and he was like that's good like really good. I chose the easier one of my two options, but I was like ok now I really want to do the other one. We ended up singing together cause it was River by Eminem and Ed Sheeran. It sounded so cool. And I did pretty good on delivering emotions in that one. Anywho that's all so far besides the fact that we went to his farm/family antique shop today and I met his Grandma, father, and mother. 

Until next time when hopefully I'll tell about our first kiss or atleast and holding. Or maybe me moving away and leaving him. 
P.s he told me through text that if it was alright with me he wanted to date me and that he really liked me, but also that we would deal with the whole moving thing when the time came.",romance

"This story is a bit lengthy! However if you‚Äôre a romantic like me, it‚Äôs worth the read ‚ò∫Ô∏è

About a month ago, I met a guy while in Florida for a conference. I traveled with a big group if people from my school. We were out at a club on a Thursday night, and he just caught my eye. We will call him Michael. I thought he was very good looking, y‚Äôall, and he smelled amazing. So I purposely bumped into him, flirted a little and told him my name. I‚Äôm not a shy girl, but I never make the first move. Something told me I would regret not shooting my shot. 

So I did! And he was into me too! We danced all night, and he got my number. I left with my friends before he did, but we texted all the next day. He drove from his nearby campus by himself to meet me the next night at another club. Again, we danced all night and closed down the club. He had parked by my hotel, so we walked back together. I stalled until all the people from my conference had trickled back to the hotel, and then we decided to go to McDonalds. We got some food, and then parked so we could talk and listen to music. He played his music, and was dancing and singing to me in his extremely off key voice! I loved it, he was so adorable. We were looking into each others eyes, kissing... we could not keep our hands off each other. It was intense. He just made my heart melt and my knees weak.. I couldn‚Äôt resist him. So at around 3:30 AM, I went with him to his dorm. 

So, I am an adult, and I attended the conference with my peers. There is no rule against staying the night someplace else, but it‚Äôs also kinda frowned upon. So my hope was to get back before anybody in my room woke up. At around 6 AM, I got back and unfortunately there were people I knew in the lobby already up for the day. I had to duck into the little elevator area so hopefully nobody would witness my walk of shame. Despite the potential embarrassment, I was so happy. Michael made me feel giddy, and he was so fun to be with. 

So it‚Äôs Saturday now. And I had to spend the day with the group I came with. We had our last big dinner event that night, and after that I was free to do what I pleased. After the dinner, the 300 some people at the conference were all going to be going out. The biggest night for it. Yet, all I wanted to do was spend time with Michael. I decided instead to go to his dorm, and we cuddled and watched Netflix that night. 

Never in my life have I had such an instant Chemistry and connection with anybody before Michael. I dated somebody for 2.5 years who never made me feel that way. That night, we didn‚Äôt just sleep together. We made love. It was so pure and good. I will always remember it. 

My flight left Sunday evening, so all we had left was the day together before my flight back to Michigan. He drove me back to my hotel, and came inside with me to get my luggage. I saw many people from the conference, but I didn‚Äôt care this time. 

That last day we spent together was nearly perfect. We got breakfast at a diner, and then walked on the beach along the ocean for 2 hours. We held hands, collected shells, and took pictures together. Then we went to some shops, got smoothies, and headed back to his dorm. I didn‚Äôt want the day to end. He didn‚Äôt have to , but he said he would drive me to the airport. 

We cuddled together on his small dorm bed, and it was so nice. But then we looked at the time, and we realized we only had about an hour left together. As I laid my head on his chest, I couldn‚Äôt seem to fight the tears. But when I looked up at him, I realized that he was crying too. 

I watched this man cry, because he didn‚Äôt want me to leave. He said he never felt such strong feelings for a girl he‚Äôd only know for 3 days. We both agreed that we did not want it to end, and that we would keep in touch. He drove me to the airport, we said our somber goodbyes, and I got on the plane. My heart was broken. 

It‚Äôs been a month now, and we still text, Snapchat, call, or FaceTime every single day. I‚Äôve never believed in love at first sight, but Michael was pretty damn close. I can‚Äôt say what will happen in the future, but life‚Äôs far too short to not believe in love ‚ù§Ô∏è",romance

"We both skateboard and we met thru mutuals who also skateboard, it‚Äôs a big skate community out here.  Never once really found her attractive or would even classify her as my type so I just never really looked her way plus also she‚Äôs gay/bi. She eventually got a job at my work and we both hit it off immediately. She was funny, very easy to get along with, and just a really nice energy to be around. We talked about girls, music, skating and all the good stuff. Again I never really thought of it as anything, until the idea of me and her together popped in my head. At first I was like no way, she‚Äôs like a sister to me and it was just weird. But then I thought that if I were to date someone, they would have to be exactly like her. And the more we worked together the more I thought about it and the more I felt myself having some kind of emotional/romantic feeling for her. Now we text each other songs and stupid memes and stuff like that. Cute shit. We had a holiday work party recently and she had asked me to come to her house before so we could go together. I‚Äôm stoked. Idk why but us going to the party together felt like a foreshadowing of a possible relationship. So we‚Äôre at the party, it‚Äôs been about an hour, drinks are flowing, everyone havin a good time. She eventually makes her way over to me. At this point it‚Äôs now or never, so I kinda drunkenly brush my face against her cheek and kinda gage her reaction to it. She looks at me and says ‚Äúkiss?‚Äù And I was like yeah, so then we kissed. And then she told me to do it again, so I did. My night was made in that moment. But she then reiterated to me that she was gay after the kiss which kinda sucked but I knew this so I respected it. Our first work shift together after the party was kinda awkward and we were both kinda stand offish. Now I‚Äôm just stuck here with feelings for someone that will  probably not reciprocate them back. It‚Äôs weird because she always used to tell me she liked dudes too, so like should I keep pursuing this or just let it go??",romance

"
We see stories and movies and fairy tails that show characters falling in love in a variety of different ways. Some couples expected, some unexpected. Some of us want a happy ever after with somebody and try to find ‚Äòthe one‚Äô to spend the rest of our lives with, but some of us fear it. Love is scary, it‚Äôs an adventure, it‚Äôs painful, it‚Äôs confusing, but most of all it‚Äôs a story. Everybody has a story, then when you fall in love with another person they become part of your story, apart of you. They can change the stories plot, ending, climax, etc. However, even the best relationships have a conflict in their story. Lucky for us though, a story has a climax which solves the conflict. Solving the conflict can change things for the better or for the worse. It can end relationships, fix relationships, improve relationships, or start relationships. It‚Äôs scary not knowing what‚Äôs going to happen. Once you start a story with somebody you are on the edge of your seat to see what happens and hope you achieve the ending you dream to have. It can be hard, some harder than others. Just because it‚Äôs hard it doesn‚Äôt mean you should give up. A challenge is good sometimes. It‚Äôs a scary challenge though. You soon realize that you would do anything and everything for a person. That somebody who may not have even been in your life for years, can one day enter your life and then you can‚Äôt go a day without them. You don‚Äôt want anything bad to happen to them, because they become a part of you that you cherish and hold onto as long as you can. You don‚Äôt want that taken away from you or anything happening to it. Then it can get harder, especially when your scared to face your fears. When your in love you fear getting hurt or hurting somebody else. You have to make tough decisions, and sometimes we make the wrong ones and it hurts. Certain decisions let you go back, however others don‚Äôt. They stick with you for the rest of your life. One decision can ruin a relationship, fix a relationship, or start a relationship. Loves not a game, you don‚Äôt want to be played with. You don‚Äôt play with somebody when your in love, it‚Äôs not a game so don‚Äôt treat it like it is.",romance
"So I‚Äôve had a revelation recently. It comes after years of this endless cycle of meeting a girl, developing a crush, overthinking my feelings,  trying to bury it, failing, not having it work, burning myself out, letting go, rinse and repeat. I was sick of it, this inability to cope with my feelings and constant compulsive worrying about wether I would meet someone whenever I went to any social gathering at all. It was exhausting and did nothing but ruin the serenity I‚Äôm trying to build in myself. 

I laid in bed one night, thoughts running through my head, and I prayed out loud. Well, I say prayed, more like talked at the air and to myself for about half an hour. I confessed my feelings, confessed how scared I felt, scared of being alone, scared of not living up to the other persons expectations, scared of what all this said about me as a person. I went round and round until I eventually grumbled ‚ÄúI give up‚Äù
Then something seemed to click, my eyes widened. Yeah, I give up. 

I don‚Äôt mean I abandoned hope and resigned myself to isolation, I mean that I suddenly realised this whole time that I was doing this to myself. It was the very pursuit and subconscious obsession with romance that was the problem. The worldly conditions had nothing to do with it, it was my reaction to those conditions that was making me miserable and it was time to give it up. I began to laugh, it was so bloody obvious now I think about it, why hadn‚Äôt I realised it sooner?!? 

So, there and then, I decided that I was going to give up the struggle. There was no struggle to be had, there never was. Whatever happens will happen. Whether I‚Äôm single, in a relationship or somewhere in between, I‚Äôm not going to fight it anymore. I‚Äôll just let life sweep me away in whatever direction it chooses, I accept it regardless. 
Obviously I still have days when I can feel the old anxieties creeping back and it may well be that I need to do a lot more work to overcome the addiction, but I know I‚Äôve made a turn towards the right direction, at last I‚Äôm beginning to break out from my self built cage. 
Thank god for that.",romance

"To begin, I want to ask for advice on what to do with this guy who has a ton of female friends that I have no idea if im different from them. So plz read the story and tell me what it sounds like to you.

I am a mess right now in so many freaking ways. Let's start with meeting the curious charactor.

This past trimester there was a guy in English class who at first I hard core judged for always being late, having airpod things (not air pods but same concept) in nearly all class till he got caught, the way he confused me on whether he was just smart and bored or attention seeking, and lastly the way he DRESSED. He wore the same genre of clothes everyday. From his sleeveless, dark, camo tanks to the boots and jeans. What really confused me was a had one of those rapper boy chains that hang out of your pocket while holding onto your wallet. Who was this guy? Then one day, there was a dreaded group presentation in the form of acting. Me being the tentative girl I am I ended up seeing almost every person in the class forming their groups of 3 in the span of 2 seconds, while I sat there looking for a decent group to join. And guess who was in a group of 2 needing an extra, yep the boy and the girl NO ONE COULD HEAR when she talked. I got forced by the teacher into that group, so I stole the teacher's spinny chair (I had no other chair where they were sitting) and joined them. He was laughing at me the whole class period while I span around in the chair every once in a while. So we chose a scene from what we were studying ( I forgot to mention, it was Romeo and Juliet) and rehearsed it. We giggled together half the time, it was fun. I ended up having a small crush on him to my dismay. 
Break: A cute story 
One day our teacher gave us an assignment on the computers and I had to go charge it in the back of the room. As I recall I answered a question he (the teach) asked, while I was listening to his response to my answer I get this feeling I should look the guy in his eyes and smile cause at that point he was in my view, I listened to it and made quick eyes contact and smiled then looked straight back at the teacher, he smiled back. It was a sweet moment I'm glad I was brave in.
Back to it:
Every once in a while we'd end up standing next to each other in line before the bell, and he would look over at me and ask me a question sorta nervously. Fast forward to the day before finals. We ended up walking to our next class together, I had no clue they were both in the same hall way on the other side of the school previously. The next day was a class discussion where his normal seat got taken cause it was in the middle circle and I sat behind his row. The seat next to me was empty cause that person's group went first. So the guy came over to me after a few seconds of hin just standing ""scanning"" the room for an open seat, and sat down next to me after saying something along the lines of  ""There aren't any other seats open.""  I was thinking I don't care, sit where you want. Anywho, I drew a tic tac board on a peice of paper, marked the middle with an O, and slid it over to him. We played that for awhile till I got bored of winning, and drew a hangman and slid it over to him we played that till it was our groups turn to go in the middle. I got up and walked to the middle, sat down (not on purpose) right next to his usual chair. He follows and sits down in his chair, and he's all like ""I swear I'm not following you this is just my seat."" I was like didn't think you were. So class ends, and we walk together to the next class, except me being the secret blonde (I'm a brunette) I am, forgot that on finals lunch is after that class period. So I was walking with him and asked why everyone was in the cafeteria. As I asked him it dawned on me, and I just had that *face palm moment. I looked back at my usual table and it was FULL people were even standing just to be near it. I told him so, and he invited me to sit with him and his friends. I was like you know what screw it let's make a new friend or two. And sat with his friends (I actually knew 75% of them) so I was like WAHHHHHH. Here is where it gets kinda cute and confusing, he starts introducing all of his friends like how they do in movies where they're like ""that's Chase the idiot, that's Bridget she's depressed as hell"" and shes like 'f*** you' and starts laughing. And it was so cute and polite of him, but also unnecessary. So we just talked and towards the end he was like, ""sooo, do you wanna sit with us tomorrow?"" I was like ~YESSS are you kidding me you guys are so funny and weird like me~ on the inside, but I told him ""I would, but I'm leaving tomorrow."" He was then like ""aw man"" and a couple minutes later I was like should I ask him for his number or snapchat?? And what do ya, he is like ""Do you have snapchat?"" I was like ""Yes"" and obliviously resumed eating. he paused for a sec and was like ""caaan I have it?"" I was like ""Ohh, yea sure!""
The next day I sent him a few pics telling him where we were and when i arrived.
 Every once in a while he'd say hi and sometimes that would turn into a long convo others i got distracted or he had to go. Mid summer he was like we haven't talked in a while, how has your summer been so far? And from then out the talking was at an all time high cause that weekend was our town's yearly summer festival, and he asked if I was gonna be at the parade. I was like, I am IN it. I asked if he was gonna be there and he was like yea. So I was like I'll look out for you and maybe say hi real quick. Ended up missing him, but he saw me (in the best moment where we were doing our super cute dance) i was like, I looked for you but I couldn't see ya. We ended up hanging out there, however, it was our first time hanging out together so we were a little shy and slightly awkward, but eventually we had fun. Another sign that he maybe was into me too, was he kept wanting to buy me something. But that wasn't the only thing, he also did something really sweet that was being really sensitive towards me and my needs, I have a low blood sugar issue and I had just been in the sun walking and cheering for and hour, so I started to get a little dizzy/lightheaded and nauseous. But I didn't tell him he just noticed and was like are you ok? I was so taken aback by this, a guy who I sorta knew could tell when I was attempting to hide not feeling well. (I let him buy some honey for me beforehand cause I could tell he really wanted to, and I didn't want to take advantage of a nice act, so that was a cheap thing) so that was already gonna to help me feel better before I began to feel sick) Skip forward I went on another vacation this one brought some world crashing news (my small world). My father wanted to move us to another state and started looking at homes while we were supposed to be on vacation without asking us beforehand. After that I didn't think it was real(denial), till everything was going so fast that I couldn't ignore what was going on. Things at home are getting super stressful and everyone is being really mean to eachother my parents to each other, my brother and my mother, my brother to me. Its was awful, on top of that we got sick with a flu thing so I told the guy how sick I was and we started talking again. Till this point I didn't want to tell him cause all I wanted to do was keep that friendship normal and not sad. But it got to a point where me telling to my mom about what was going on inside my head was not an option cause I didn't want to give her one more reason to want to give up and leave my dad. So I told him, cause sadly enough, I don't really have many true friends anymore. I decided to give him a chance since he was the person I'd been praying for, the person who WANTED to be around me who TOOK initiative to talk to me, invite me to things, and everything. The previous year, no one (but one person kinda) did that I was crying all the time cause of how lonely it was since I fell out with my middle school best friend. What amazes me was that after I did tell him, he asked me questions about+made sure I was ok not only that be even though i was on the road for leaving the state sometime soon, he STILL wanted to be around me no matter what mood I was in. And previously this week after a little while of silence he said hey and invited me to a thing called music on the green. I couldn't go, but we planned to go to something the next day. But then I realized I'd already seen the movie that was playing several times, so I worked really hard that day and my parents actually let me go hangout with him no conditions (except be home by 8 which I broke woops). So I get to the ice cream place where we decided on meeting at. What was super sweet and ahhh, I got my own ice cream with my coupon and I HATED it. I mentioned that I really didn't like the flavor cherry, and you know what he did??? He freaken got me another even though I refused to let him. We sat on the bench outside for a while and talked. About the move a tiny bit but i tried to keep it off that subject, cause who wants a drag for a friend right? He made the point of ""what type of friend wouldn't want to listen to their friend when that person is going through something?"" Next we were just walking and went past a bed store and he was like, you wanna go in? I was like hmm ... hmmm.. then I was yet again like screw it this'll be a funny story to tell one day. So we went in and that ended up being sooo fun. We walked to walmart and I found my other actual friend the one I mentioned earlier there, so we hung out with her for a little while. She actually knew him too and apparently calls him Tarzan. She had to go with her parents, and I was like that was pretty much my only real friend, and he just got this look on his face and asked then what am I? And I was like well at first you were just a friend but not quite a real one, the you got better? It was really awkward cause I didn't want to friend zone him, but I also didn't want to deny how much his friendship had begun to mean to me. After that we got my bike and I decided to just walk home with him (we live near eachother) it was so nice. I felt the best I'd felt in weeks and laughed harder and more too. At one point we asked the same thing at the same time. That moment was just so hilarious and we found something we had in common from it. When we reached my house he stopped and was like ""so just so we're clear, I was wondering if you wanted to hangout again."" I just couldn't keep a straight face so I smiled and said ""yes""  he then said something about not scaring me off. So ever since then, my minds just been going crazy, wth does he like me or not. Am I just a friend like all his other numerous friends? Or was that a date and he likes me and it's just an unsaid thing. I have a gut feeling that he may, but on the other hand he could just be trying to be kind and polite towards me. 
About half way through writing this, I was thinking ""I'm moving in either a month or over that I just don't know, should i just send this to him explaining everything that has happened from my point of view. And hopefully he'll respond positively. If not then I can move on and just stay his friend if he'll let me."" 

In case I have shown this to you, Michael, you already know by this point but I like you more than just a treasured friend who has helped me more than he knows just by saying hi when he doesn't even know I've just had a rough day. I'm sorry if me showing you this has made you uncomfortable, or anything. If you don't like me back, please just tell me, I'm stronger than you think I can handle rejection it's fine. If you do, it's up to you what happens next. The ball is now in your court man.",romance

"What I write today I do so with great hesitation.  All of what I write is true but if it is ever read, it will be hurtful.  However, I can‚Äôt apologize for honesty.  

For the past few weeks, I have been really struggling.  I woke up an old me that used to be me and this old me does not recognize or accept the world we live in.  I can understand, that old me is the real me crying out through 27 years of darkness wanting to live again and living with the moment he gave up and let the darkness take over.  I would give everything short of my soul to get that back, but even at that price, I can not see a way how that would ever be possible.  

There once was a me that was happy but lonely, purely romantic believing the slightest glimpse of hope in a sea of impossibility.  He just wanted love, believed in love, and loved the idea of love.  He had a faith but a more simple one.  He loved Jesus but wasn‚Äôt  full of love-killing theology and a church culture where image was everything.  There was a darkness then, but that darkness came from a place he did not know then and it was weak and in the background.  It made me fearful of hurt and hard to trust, but I met someone who saw that and broke through all that.  I found love.

As love is, that love ebbed and flowed at times but I never lost it.  She was my everything and even now that me believes losing her was the worst thing to ever happen in my life.  I can not disagree, that love overwhelmed the dark until the end.  But then something happened, something that tore through the trust I had and hurt me deeply.  At that point I had the choice to face that pain and work through it and make our love stronger than it ever was.  Instead, I opened the door to the dark and that me went to sleep.  I remember that day, in her bedroom, saying one thing while feeling my heart grow cold.  I felt my own death, or so I thought, and was determined to lash out.  This decision, in the end, ruined my life.  I am sure she found the love and happiness she deserves but as for me, I found nothing but cold, hurt, and emptiness and its something I still feel to this day.  

You see, at that moment I changed my life from the course it was supposed to take to where it is now.  I am living a life I was never meant to live.  How else can I explain why I find no joy, no fulfillment, no love, no peace, and living a life of perpetual failures.  Sure I put a lot of lipstick on this pig of a life, but once you scrape past the surface you see whats really there.  What you see is black.  What you see is death.  

Also how can you explain how this once nice loving romantic boy became the selfish heart-consuming monster that he has been.  I did not start off that way, but where I went after I left the first beat whatever humanity was left in my heart into nothing and whatever old the old me was left inside went deep into hiding.  She was evil, and to beat that evil, in the end I became more evil.  When I think about what I have done, all the lies I have told, all the ones I got to fall in love with me for a time just to get me to  the next ‚Äúreal‚Äù love, all the others I hurt but drawing some out of relationships all to just get tired of them and break it off slowly until they left me.  I was so good at being what I needed to be that I even forgot that I lost the real me.  

As for those ‚Äúreal‚Äù loves? Please.  They were just longer versions of the insignificant ones or ones who ultimately betrayed me and felt my emotional wrath.  I was so good at winning people back even after they left me.  

But no matter how many hearts I stole I could never fill the hole that was inside mine.  I never realized that instead of trying to find the next real love, I needed to be looking at the past to the one I actually had.  The dark would not let me.  I talked about that one so many times, looked at pictures, read notes in yearbooks, and really felt nothing.  

That is why this present situation is so perplexing. Why now after so many years has this suddenly been revealed?  Why open a door and let someone out into a world that is so detached from his reality that  all I can feel is his pain crying out from where he is tucked inside me and  insanely in love for someone not even seen for literally decades?  Is this some tragic hoax just to torture me a little more for the mistakes I made?  Or is it more?  The romantic part of old me wants to believe that it is.  That somehow someone else is feeling the same way and somehow this will all work out and in such a way that causes minimal pain.   Yes, I know the logic of that but remember the old me has a hard time accepting anything as impossible.  

What I do know is that I want to be old me again.  What I also know is that I can not be old me  without any connection to my world today.  What I also know is that I know of one person who can help.  What I also know is that living like I am now in a world I do not belong in as a me that is not real is not sustainable much longer.  I know that for the sake of my own emotional survival this all has to work out.  And therein lies the dilemma.  I do not see a way where  it can.  I am too respectful to even attempt to reach back into someone‚Äôs life and I do not know if I can handle it being unwelcome.  I am presently too weak for that.  I used to believe that love looking always finds love looking back.  That old me still does and it is hope that keeps me from completely breaking down each and every day.  How much more can I take of this? I dont know but I dont think its much.",romance

Prologue

The wind was cold on her pale cheeks, and her golden hair was swept in blowing curls behind her. The snowflakes settled on her black cloak, as if sprinkling it with glitter. She breathes in, then out, in slow motions, letting her mind roam free. She turns, seeing the arrow come towards her, and with a leap, and a quick kick in the air, she‚Äôs off the horse, arrow in hand. And she hollered, loud enough for her attacker to know to never attack once more.


Chapter 1


‚ÄúBeth?‚Äù I can hear him calling. I throw on a nightgown, and scamper to the room beside mine. ‚ÄúYes Father?‚Äù I call as I hurry to the study. He‚Äôs draped over the desk, his pen scribbling on the paper heavily and his brow furrowed. ‚ÄúGo fetch your Mother for me will you?‚Äù he barks out, treating me like a servant. ‚ÄúFather, I was going to go see the king.‚Äù I say, stopping in the doorway. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù He says with a huff, and reaches behind him to pull the bell to alert the servants.",romance
"Hey all, first time posting on reddit. I was hoping for some input on a love letter I'm sending to a girl I have had a charged friendship with for several years. I essentially lay everything out in the letter if you have any questions let me know.

Dearest T,

I‚Äôm sorry if I did something the other night that put you off. That being said I just wanted to put my feelings onto paper so that hopefully you would understand.
    I have known you for the better part of 8 years, even though we didn‚Äôt really talk to one another in Jr. High other than from musicals. When I saw your post from way back when and decided to message you, it was not by any stretch out of pity. At that time you were more mature than me and you gave me an ideal. You inspired me to better myself at first, and through that I was able to grow to the point where I could care about myself. Previous to our date I had only ever been on awkward dates that were no fun at all, because of that it blew me away when we had so much fun so easily. We hung out a few more times and talked every night. Each day adding to my motivation, fueling my fire.
    Not too much longer after that you got back together with Gavin and I was a bit confused but I understood. There was no anger or anything of that nature in my heart. Then I moved up to Ogden, we kept in touch but it always seemed strained so I decided to focus on growth as an individual and left you to do whatever you wanted to do for the rest of your senior year.
    The summer of 2016 I took a big risk and decided to take a job on the other side of the country. This job tore me down and stripped me of any confidence I had built up over the last year since being an adult. I was rejected everyday, sometimes close to a hundred times per day. It got to the point where I was barely able to eat. At my lowest point over there I decided to hop on facebook and I saw that you were hurting too. I decided to message you just to say hey and see how you were holding up. For the next few weeks you kept me going. Just you messaging me and being nice to me when nobody else was, was enough for me to stay out on the doors. The thought of you made me want to be as successful as I could be, so that I could come back home having made enough money just to spoil you. In the end I buckled under the pressure and couldn‚Äôt go on any longer. By a stroke of magnificent luck I made it back to (REDACTED) without too much struggle.
    When I got back however,  the only thing I could think about was taking you out. We ended up going to 25th street and just walking around. That day still stands out in my mind as one of my favorite dates just because I could tell you cared at least a bit. I know I should have kissed you in that cave, and who knows what could have happened. Nonetheless when it came time for your graduation party, you having gotten back together with Gavin, I was still a shell of who I was before I left but I decided to go regardless of my feelings for you just to wish you luck and prosperity. 
I even now harbor no ill will towards you. I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt realize how much you helped me but I wanted you to know that no matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, I will always care about you. You have inspired me many times to push myself to grow. You were the only source of light when my world was at its darkest. I can‚Äôt just idly sit by when I know you‚Äôre in so much pain.
    I know that you‚Äôve said you‚Äôre a grenade but honestly T. I would jump on that grenade for you in a heartbeat. I owe a lot of who I have become, to you. You may believe that you‚Äôre beyond help but you‚Äôre not. I don't want to change you, I want to be there for you, to listen and hear about what‚Äôs stressing you out or what‚Äôs making you happy, to show you the light that you‚Äôve shown me and to make you smile big toothy smiles so I can see the adorable gap in your teeth. I believe in the person you want to become. I know that you need space and I‚Äôm more than willing to give you as much as you need but please, let me be there for you like you were there for me. 
                    Cordially yours, and always extra

I'm stupid for saving me for this girl even though most likely we never will more than friends? I tried to get over her and meet new girls but I feel horrible about it. In my brain I know I should move on but my heart tells me that there may be hope. We have  some friends in common and they all root for me, they also say that her boyfriend is a piece of shit (lol). Maybe that's where my hope is? I never confessed to her because I respect her relationship. Also because my previous relationship ended thanks to a guy confessing to my girlfriend knowing she was with me, and sadly she ended up cheating with him . I don't want to be that type of person who steals another's girl.",romance

He gave my heart hope and brought light back into my life. I am grateful for the time he spent with me because I really needed it. Now that he‚Äôs gone I truly miss him but I hope that he‚Äôs doing what makes him happy. I thank him for helping me heal.

"Hello, I am reaching out to this group in hopes that someone might recall the plot snippets I have listed below of a Gothic Romance book that I once read a long time ago. Unfortunately, I no longer know the title or the author.  This Gothic Romance book would be considered a bit out of date for today's society, but every once in a while I start to think about this story and I have been searching for some time in hopes of finding it to re-read it.  I stumbled upon Gothic Mystery Romance books when visiting a book resell shop towards the late 70s and I did pick up some Harlequin books, as well ‚Ä¶ not sure what this Trashy story may be classified as, but the following story snippets is what I recall.

**What I can remember of our heroine (virgin): approx. age of 18 to early 20s**

* ¬∑ a young adult woman who lost her parents (mother probably at an early age), the story starts at the time of her father's death or son thereafter;
* ¬∑ No male heir, the estate is either entailed to another relative or a complete stranger who has purchased the estate (wish I could remember betters):
* ¬∑ Heroine is able to stay on and live in the families estate due to she is a relative or out of kindness from the new owner.
* ¬∑ She is able to keep her bedroom in the estate and I feel as though she is ignored with not a lot to do.
* ¬∑ I feel as though when she comes back to the estate after she ran away to the neighbors, she is given the role of running the home.
* ¬∑ It may even turn out that she is pregnant.

**Male (strong) hero: Probably in his 30s (like most of these genre stories)**

* ¬∑ New owner/master of the estate is an arrogant type of hero and not sure how he came to be the new master after the death of the heroine father;
* ¬∑ Seems to be an angry man and may have had a bad relationship with another woman or may be forced to get married.
* ¬∑ I feel as though the heroine and staff may have greeted the new master at the top of the steps, just outside the front door

**Setting:**  I am sure if it is in England or if it is along the eastern coastline in America, but I recall there was references made throughout the book that the heroine enjoyed walks along the cliffs and past the young man‚Äôs home (the neighbor to the estate)

**Supporting characters**:

* ¬∑ A young man but a bit older than her lives next door with his aging father or maybe grandfather.
* ¬∑ The young man loves our heroine, but she does not know until later;

**Bits I recall of the Plot:**

* ¬∑ The male Hero becomes ill (not sure why) and our Heroine is nursing him during the evening in order for the housekeeper to get her rest and during one of her night watches with our Hero, he was out of mind with a fever and as she was caring for him, he grabbed her and she ends up in his bed and being pinned under him, he has his way with her and takes her virginity. As it started out as a rape, I believe the heroine ended up being a participant in the act and that is what the master is troubled by of thoughts of a passionate encounter.
* ¬∑ After that incident, the Heroine must have covered it up so that the staff would not be aware the next morning and she does not say anything about the episode when a staff member arrives that morning after;
* ¬∑ When the hero/master does recovers from his illness, he is nagged by a sense of something did happen and needs to find the person who was in his room that night;
* ¬∑ He does not believe it was a dream as it seemed too passionate and real to him to be anything but what really happened;
* ¬∑ At some point in the story, the master does find out that it was our Heroine who was in his bed that night. (not sure how he finds out and not sure if it has to do with why our heroine runs away, but she goes to the house of the young man);
* ¬∑ While she is at the young man‚Äôs home, he confesses his love for her but she doesn‚Äôt feel the same towards him;
* ¬∑ Our hero/master does go in search of her at the neighbor‚Äôs home and he may know that it was her or not until later in the story, but she does return to the estate;
* ¬∑ I recall her being in the dining room with the housekeeper maybe getting ready for a party, but it maybe when the master confronts her about that night or maybe that she is pregnant and does the right thing by asking her to marry him.

I hope you can help me find this story!",romance
"What is love? Must it be manipulative? Must I play a game? Cannot I just be myself? Am I not worth loving for me? Must I pretend to something I'm not? Must I hide how I really feel?

I can be me with friends, with strangers, but I cannot be me with the one who matters most? I want a love where I can be me. Where I can be free. Where she feels the same. Where she can be her.

opportunity of traveling from a Third World country to Canada to pursue his Masters as well as a job to go with. All these along with visa, and other necessary documents had already been secured for him by his elder brother who had initially called and advised him from experience on the matter; that the love most women have for their men is fair-weather love, that most of them, due to their nature cannot withstand tough time, that if he is in any relationship, he should end it no matter how serious or how far it has gone, that love will always come and go but that such a rare opportunity, when it comes and goes, it may never come back.

"So idk why I‚Äôm posting this but I just needed to tell someone this story that is making me feel like I‚Äôm in a movie lol. So basically I used to work at a certain clothing store and this guy got hired a little while after me. I didn‚Äôt really think much of him besides the fact that we were good work friends and shot the shit a lot. He had a girlfriend and was not totally my type so I didn‚Äôt even picture him that way. After a few months I left the store to move on to another job. He still works there though and we both have a great relationship with the other people that work there. So the other day he asks me out of nowhere (like I haven‚Äôt spoken to him in maybe 6 months) whether or not I wanna come to the store‚Äôs Christmas party with him and see everyone. So I say yeah that sounds fun and go. All night he is being kinda flirty with me but I guess I‚Äôm kinda dim cause I still didn‚Äôt think much of it until at the end of the night he say we should totally get drinks some time. To which I was like yeah that would be great, the only problem is (and here is the kicker) I am moving in less than a week half way across the country. So I tell him this and he says he wants to get dinner and drinks regardless. So we make a plan for like 3 days later. Which was tonight. We went to a couple bars I had never been to before and had an amazing time. We then walked down to the boardwalk in our little east cost town where there are hammocks and he finally kissed me. We ended up making out a bit and chatting in between. We mostly spoke about how sad it is that we feel like this could be so great if only I weren‚Äôt leaving and his timing wasn‚Äôt so bad. We both are on career paths that we know are never going to be stable or in one place. So we walk up to where I have to get my bus home and are making out in the bus stop and he is saying such sweet things to me that I tear up a little. I shit you not this felt surreal. Then the bus comes and we have this dramatic goodbye kiss and now I doubt I‚Äôll see him and again for a long time even though he told me to keep in touch. I know this is not really a question or anything but I just wanted to share because it feels a little crazy right now. Almost like star crossed lovers lol.

"Okay so I (25F) started talking to this man (26M) We have known each other for years; about 15, but we had not seen eachother since middle school until January of this year. Now that we are in each others life's where we can physically hang out I realized that I don't know much about him anymore. We would talk on the days of MySpace but that was so long ago. I already have a hard time being social with others because of my own past and insecurities. And now I realized that he is socially awkward as well.

Now what worries me is that we may not have anything to talk about. The way the world is now people are so glued to cell phones or tv and I fear that intelligence and enlightened conversations are just out the window.

Also. He is getting a divorce and I am still living with my ex for financial reasons. We have no money saved to move apart. But have agreed to no longer be in a relationship.

That being said. I truly fear that it would be best for me to be with my ex permanently because we have those enlightened conversations. The what if's about the world and theories. And we can talk for hours about seemingly nothing. Yet I do not love my ex. It is disheartening. Because the way I feel about my friend of 15 years is far different. I have always loved him just for who he is and his demeanor. And I do in fact look forward to us going on real dates and having those long talks. Am I just paranoid and over thinking it? My biggest fear is not having anything to say because my brain can be empty sometimes. That's what happens when someone does nothing but work, shit, eat and sleep. More than anything I don't want him to think I'm an idiot.

How would you go about talking to someone you want a future with? How do you deepen the connection between you and that person? For God's sakes how do normal people talk to each other? Because apparently I'm not normal.",romance

What do you do when you profess your love to a woman and she is literally moving out from living with her boyfriend that day...but you didn't know that because you just met her like 2 weeks ago...?,romance
"She‚Äôs such a sweetheart, we‚Äôve had so many laughs and so much fun, and we‚Äôre so attracted to each other. I have trouble imagining my life without her and I want her to be happy. Trouble is, we‚Äôre both broken. 

I‚Äôve been trying to better myself, but it‚Äôs been really hard for me. I was unemployed for several years after graduating high school because I struggled with anxiety and depression. I finally took a fast food job, and I feel like I barely make enough money to survive on my own, if I had an apartment with a roommate. I‚Äôll be going back to school in the spring to learn welding, though.

She‚Äôs currently unemployed (recently lost her job with my employer) and abuses her body with alcohol and cigarettes. She also smokes weed and occasionally uses psychedelics. She struggles with social anxiety because her mother emotionally abused her, and is deeply depressed because two of her boyfriends died young. She constantly wants to hurt herself and wants to die, but keeps reassuring me she won‚Äôt kill herself. She doesn‚Äôt eat much, so she‚Äôs tiny and usually low on energy. She thinks she‚Äôs going to die young from substance abuse, and so do I. I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve imagined her death and cried.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. She occasionally beats around the bush about marriage, but also tells me she won‚Äôt marry me because she considered her recently-departed boyfriend her ‚Äúhusband‚Äù, and hasn‚Äôt broken off their relationship in her heart. She also sometimes talks about ‚Äúdisappearing‚Äù, meaning leaving town with friends to start a new life somewhere out there. I don‚Äôt believe she could survive on her own, since she hasn‚Äôt learned to be a functional adult, but I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt make enough money to take care of her as a housewife.

My mind and pretty much all my friends tell me it‚Äôs a bad idea to be romantically-involved with her, but sometimes it feels like she‚Äôs my heart living outside of my body. This is the most painful dilemma I‚Äôve ever been faced with.",romance

"Me (16M) and my best friend (16F) have been friends for upwards of 10 years. We always enjoyed each other's company and have never fought or argued in the slightest and our families are also very good friends. We text and face time constantly and i've been secretly in love with her for the past 5 years although I doubt she feels the same way, which just makes this worse. We also don't go to the same school anymore so I can't see her in person as often as I would like to. Anyways, everything is fine until about a month ago when in the middle of a conversation she stopped responding to my texts, but was reading all of my messages. At first i thought she was messing with me like we always do with each other, but after a couple of days I started to get confused and asked her why she wasn't responding to my messages, again she left me on read. Not long after, she made a post on instagram somewhere along the lines of people not getting the hint that she didn't want to talk. This is when i really began to worry, I panicked and sent a **lot** messages asking what was wrong and if she was ok, again left on read. A couple days passed and she made another instagram post which said that nobody asked how she was doing and meant it anymore, under which I commented ""..."". Her response, still in the comments, was that spamming her DMs did not show that I cared (which she couldn't be more wrong about) and that I only spoke to her as a last resort when I was bored. I then responded by messaging her that she was anything but a last resort and that I cared about her only to be left on read again. She then made a third and final post on instagram directed towards me saying to stop messaging her. I was really hurt by this but wanted to respect her wishes, so I sent her one last massage. I told her that I was sad that she didn't want to be my friend but its ok and that I would be there if she ever wanted to talk, and that I would miss her. I also apologized for possibly inadvertently making her feel like a last resort. One last time she left me on read. Where do I go from here?",romance

	The smell of blood permeated the dark room. The body lay lifeless on the floor. Given the small space, the salty, coppery smell was unmistakable. I stood against the wall trying to distance myself from the grotesque scene playing out before me. My gaze moved down to the floor watching the pool of dark crimson liquid growing larger and nearing my Jimmy Choo‚Äôs. I stepped to the side avoiding the advancing blood and tried to keep my food down. At times like this in my job, I try my best to tune out and focus on something..happier. Most of the time it doesn‚Äôt work. Like now. All I hear is the second man being interrogated and tortured whenever he doesn‚Äôt answer correctly. I can‚Äôt imagine what he is feeling right now. But given the accusations, he does deserve it. I glanced up seeing tall men on either side of me, their hands behind their backs. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going anywhere. If I do, I‚Äôll either be blackmailed or killed. My whole body jolted as a shot fired and I heard the thud. That sure didn‚Äôt last long. I kept my gaze down to the floor as even more blood painted the surface. 
‚ÄúWe are done here,‚Äù a low husky voice said. Black Oxford shoes walked past mine and the door opened. ‚ÄúLena.‚Äù He demanded. Everytime he talks to me, a shiver runs through my spine. And not in the good way. 
‚ÄúYes, Boss, ‚Äú I answered quickly. I turned and followed after him. Now you must be thinking. How the hell did I get in this situation? Have you ever regretted a decision you made?  In my case it was a couple months back. I wanted to be a freelance photojournalist taking the jobs only I wanted. But then my old boss hired me for one last job, the wrong job, and shit went downhill from there.

Chapter 1
Lena

A few months ago. 
I woke up from my deep slumber, the sun hitting my eyes instantly. Guess I forgot to pull down the blinds again.  My eyes were irritated from the glaring light. I sat up in my cotton sheets, sliding out of bed and rubbing my feet on my furry white rug. I glanced over at my nightstand. 6:00 a.m. Sometimes I really just want to go back to sleep and never go outside in public again. But there is a thing called a job and bills that will not pay themselves. I groaned in annoyance and stood up ruffling my long, wavy, black hair that stopped almost at my waist. After doing my normal routine of brushing my teeth, washing my face and taking a quick shower, I got ready for my work day. I work for a private investigator - for now - since he is doing a case about recent murders happening in the city. I guess you could say I am an investigator too given I‚Äôm taking the photos. But sometimes I really am worried that I‚Äôm going to get shot one of these days. I walked over to my dresser and pulled out a simple white v neck, a black hoodie and some denim washed skinny jeans. After I pulled on all my clothes, I tied the laces of my black converse extra tight today. I glimpsed over at the mirror on my wall fixing a few strands of my hair pulling them behind my ears. My pale skin and brown eyes stared back at me. I checked the time on my phone and cursed, grabbing my backpack. It had my Canon, a few rolls of film, charger, and some notes. ",romance

"So this situation is that my husband and I have been married for almost 15 years now and we started our lives together in a pretty rough spot.. Rough as in didn't have a home to call our own, making just over $1,000 per month between the 2 of us and me very pregnant.. The ring my husband proposed to me with was an opal his mom gave him that was waaaayyy too big for my finger and couldn't afford to resize. We purchased our wedding rings off of Ebay for maybe $60 for the set--his and hers.

We busted our asses to do better financially--I continued with school while staying home with our son and my husband continued to become more successful in the automotive industry. Fast forward a decade later and we've gone from barely scraping by to making well over $100,000 per year and our son not knowing what it's like to be in need. So doing pretty well 

Around our 12th anniversary, my husband had dropped clues that he was going to get me a ring--of course I had shown him the styles that I preferred any time we were in a jewelry store. However, when he finally presented me with his chosen ring on our Anniversary it was nothing like I had shown him... in fact, it was almost the opposite.. I was disappointed but also really really hurt. But I wore it happily for him even though it made me sad. And it made me sad and upsate every day I wore it and saw it on my finger because it felt like he bought this ring without really thinking of me..

Fast forward to now. I had been online ""window shopping"" for rings and shared 5 or so different styles that I loved with my husband. He didn't have much of a response, so I asked him if it bothered him at all that I was looking at rings and he said no--note: some time around 2018 I finally told him that I wasn't very happy with the ring and that I thought he would have picked out something more like what I'd shown him; this lead to a guilt trip. So I ended up buying a ring that I absolutely love about a week ago. A natural opal surrounded by diamonds. It reminded me of when he proposed to me when we literally had nothing and how far we've come. 

So we were out Christmas shopping earlier today, which reminded me of the ring I bought so I tell him about it. He proceeded to get angry with me, took his wedding band off and now won't speak to me. He told me how much I had hurt his feelings since the ring he got me ""wasn't good enough"" and told me to at least give him the other ring back so he could return it. I reminded him that I had told him that the ring he picked wasn't what I liked and that when I asked if he minded that i was looking at other rings he had said no. It was basically at that point that he stopped talking to me and wouldn't even look at me.

Did I completely misread the situation? Should I have just kept my mouth shut and grinned and beared it despite feeling hurt? Should I have just waited patiently after another decade passed..?",romance

"Have you ever noticed that when a girl asks a guy out she is seen as either desperate or aggressive? I have never been someone who was good at waiting for the guy to make the first move, and to be honest it hasn‚Äôt really worked out in my favor. My friends say that my methods are too aggressive. ‚ÄúLet them come to you.‚Äù The only thing that runs through my mind though is ‚Äòwhat if they never do.‚Äô 

How is someone supposed to know you like them if you do not say it? If I decide not to take initiative and nothing ever happens then I will always wonder, what if.

I like a boy. I have not felt this kind of giddy sensation in years. I just have no clue if he is even interest in me.

Here is some background. He is in my class. There is exactly one week left in the semester and only one day left of the class I have with him. After this I will probably never see him again. I only have two options, make the first move, or move on and keep him as a crush of the past. 

I want to tell him how I feel, but I fear that my confession will most likely come as a surprise. We have only ever texted in group messages and I have never hung out with him outside of class. I almost feel stupid for obsessing over a guy that I guess I do not really know.

The first day of class I saw him and I just felt it. It‚Äôs not something over the top like love at first sight or anything, but I felt that spark. The more I got to know him in class the harder I fell, but he has no idea.

The worst thing that could happen is ultimately rejection. I have been able to handle rejection in the past. It doesn‚Äôt feel good. It never does. However, I have never been rejected by a boy I truly have feelings for. 

I‚Äôm scared of being rejected, but I‚Äôm also scared that I will never talk to him again. He makes me excited to go to class, which is insane because college kinda sucks. It is hard and stressful, but everyday when I had that class I felt happy. 

I was planning on texting him when the semester ended. However, I want to go into my last day of class with him knowing how I feel. Too bad I do not have the balls to actually do it.

I was hoping that if I waited long enough maybe he would eventually make some kind of move or a sign that he is at all interested, but he hasn‚Äôt. This means that my confession will most likely end in rejection. If it does then I just have to remember that one day someone will want me and this guy just was not the one. It will happen. I am just tired of waiting for the day when it does.

Update: for anyone who wants to know: I asked him to hang out and this is his exact response ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôd be down to. But I don‚Äôt want to give you the wrong impression. I‚Äôm not looking for anything ‚Äú 
So yeah I‚Äôm currently feeling pretty bad. He said we will talk more about it in class on Wednesday

"Chapter 3 - Carry Me Downstairs

Jiang Sese was also staring at him in confusion.

It was obvious from the pretty boy's clothes that he wasn't an ordinary person.

The way he was looking at her, however, was hard to describe.

It was as if he was assessing‚Ä¶ a rare object.

Such a thought made her feel rather ridiculous.

Yan Yifei wasn't a patient person. She barked at the pretty boy, ""Who are you? Don't you know that you can't barge into an office during work hours?

""What a pest!""

The pretty boy gave her a nonchalance glance, looking both cold and detached. He extended his little finger to point to Yan Yifei and said in a commanding tone, ""You! Clean the mess on the floor right now. Remember: Use. Your. Hands!""

Yan Yifei thought she was hallucinating. She was so flabbergasted and furious that she laughed. ""What did you say?""

He dared to command her to wipe the floor?

""Don't you understand me?"" The pretty boy shot her a disdainful look. ""It's fine to be ugly, but how can you also be so stupid? Looks like this is what this agency amounts to. This young master really needs to reconsider if I should put you in charge of my birthday banquet!!""

Yan Yifei never imagined that this little thing could possess such a poisonous tongue. She was so angry that she was trembling all over. ""Where is this wild kid from? Didn't your parents teach you? I'm going to teach you a lesson you'll never forget!""

She raised her hand and tried to slap the pretty boy.

Jiang Sese jumped in fright and threw herself at the pretty boy out of conditioned reflex, pulling him into her embrace.

Just how painful would it be if such a young child was slapped?

The others were also startled, all of them wondering how on earth did Yan Yifei find it in her to slap such an adorable child.

"Alright so my brother has been friends with this boy, let‚Äôs name him Diego, for about 4 years or so. They‚Äôre only one year older than me. Whenever they hung out at my house I would try to just mind my own business and not go near them at all, mainly because Diego made me nervous since he is really good looking . A while back, he added me on snapchat and we started a streak, of course i only snapchatted him when i didn‚Äôt look like a freaking man without makeup. We often talked a lot over text after a couple of weeks and when he came to my house to hang out with my brother, I found myself trying to get near them like when they were in the living room i would go to the kitchen ( nearest place to living room). Diego and I would exchange some stares and smiles but that was it. Soon enough Diego and I would start flirting over text but when my brother found out about that he didn‚Äôt allow Diego to come over anymore which had me triggered, but it didn‚Äôt stop Diego and I from texting lmfao. A couple of months passed and my brother eventually forgot about me and Diego then started inviting him over again. Recently, last week when Diego slept over, my brother fell asleep early so Diego and I met up in the living room and made out, which was a mess cause it was hella dark so i was just hoping i wouldn‚Äôt accidentally bite his face or some shit like that idk it was my first kiss so my bitchass didn‚Äôt know wtf i was doing. Anyways, I don‚Äôt know if I should stop talking to him out of respect for my brother cause he‚Äôs against it or keep talking to Diego cause it‚Äôs what I want. My brother isn‚Äôt usually the protective type with me and doesn‚Äôt really care when i think his friends are hot but for some reason it‚Äôs different with Diego.



update: yea hes a fuckboy and i was wrong ab him thats tough ",romance

"So, a couple of you have commented and messaged me about me last post on ""not over him"". I'd like to give more clarification and explain it all in this post so I don't have to miss out on detail if I had replied back individually.

I met this stud of a dude when I was six at church. At this age, love isn't something you think of. We grew close because his sister and I were friends so I'd always go over to their house over summer or break. Most of you may think that he wouldn't come hang with us but he actually did. We watched movies together and talked a bit when his sister left the room. This went on for a couple of years but I still had no feelings for him. 

Then one day, his friends tell me that he likes me and I'm confused and flattered by it all. I didn't care too much about it at the time but things just got awkward because everyone would continuously tease us (btw this was when I was like 12 or 13). We kinda stopped talking which kinda made me sad. I'm not sure exactly when I started having a crush on him but I think it was when he kind of moved on from having a crush on me.

When it was time for us to pick what colleges we'd attend, we started talking more. During this time, he'd leave me on read or won't open my messages but would reply on a group chat that we were both on. Not to be over dramatic, but it just felt uncomfortable because I'd reply to his messages at least within the hour or so.  In the end, we ended up choosing the same college.",romance
"(long distance relationship)

Today, she (35 F) asked me (38M) to ft because she wanted some confidence for a FT job interview, unfortunately I couldn't ft at that moment and I asked why did she need to ft me to feel confident?, She said, because it would made her feel ""in the mood"" and because I help her.

I tried to tell her how good she is at what she does, and what the contractors might be looking for, so she could focus on certain details (honestly, I felt like I didn't do much).
Just a minute ago she called me to tell me that interview went good, and that she thanks me for helping her feeling confidence, ending with a ""that's why I love you"".

Sometimes you never know how you can help thar loved one, but that is why I love her too, because we never know how much we help each other by caring and knowing what to say at the right moment.

How had you supported your loved one ok a way that you didn know you was doing it ?",romance
"Hello!
It‚Äôs coming up to my year anniversary with my boyfriend - unfortunately we‚Äôve both had to be separated from eachother in the lockdown in the Uk.

We live very close by to eachother so I‚Äôve been able to speak to him whilst he‚Äôs been on his balcony (on my daily walk) but I‚Äôd love to be able to do something special for him without the concern of breaking lockdown rules here.

Does anyone have anything that would be a nice idea? I don‚Äôt want to leave gifts etc as the risk of infection might be high with dropping items off at his house (he has severe asthma) 
He has been alone in his flat so is struggling a lot.
Any ideas appreciated!",romance
"As I find myself feeling lost in these long uneventful days without her, I still can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking of how lucky I was to spend the short amount of time I was able too with her. I‚Äôm usually not one for the heartbreak stuff and expressing my feelings especially when it makes me vulnerable but this girl she broke down that wall. I used to be the guy who didn‚Äôt believe in love anymore. I never was one to fall relatively easy as it was. Usually when things ended with a girl I moved on and didn‚Äôt look back and honestly didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt think that there was ‚Äòthe one‚Äô or a soulmate. Because how could there be just one person who is meant for someone with all these people in the world? I‚Äôve had my shares of heartbreak even as far as being engaged and it ending because of an affair. This one though, this one hit hard and hurt bad. 

It was one of those moments that you think back on and wonder how it even happened. One of those nights where you are working until almost 11pm on a Saturday night, all you want to do is go home shower and hit the bed. That was my typical Saturday night. I get a phone call from my best friend who moved out of state a while back so when we are in each others area we try to catch up. He happened to be down in my hometown for the weekend and told me to come out with him. I hesitated because I was exhausted and I know the nights him and I have when we are together‚Ä¶holy hell. None the less I meet up with him and he is with a (girl) friend of his and her two friends and there she was‚Ä¶.

There she was standing there all 5 foot of her, deep brown eyes, hair a mess from a long day of partying but still cuter than any girl in that place. Standing in a corner in the back of the bar by the pool table. We were introduced, she commented on a tattoo of mine and that was that. As the group moved to the dance floor I think that‚Äôs when I actually got hooked. She started dancing and rapping to some song which now after knowing her she probably didn‚Äôt know half of the words but still nailed it, all eyes on her. It was exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for in a partner. Someone who can have a great time and not care what others thought. We ended up going to the casino and I ended up back at her hotel. The next day I contacted her on social media and sent her my number‚Ä¶up until a couple weeks ago we talked every day and I couldn‚Äôt even tell you half the things we talked about. There were times I would have a Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Text message notifications within minutes of each other and vice versa. i can honestly say she was my everything for those 3 months and me meeting her was the best thing that happened to me. She made me fall. Fall hard and quick. 

I know it sounds absolutely crazy that in that short amount of time someone can feel the way i feel about you. All i can say to y'all is you haven't met her. And to the lucky ones who have gotten a chance, will get a chance and will get another chance to make her yours understand what you have. Not everyone is as lucky as us to come across someone like this. So appreciate her‚Ä¶everything about her and don‚Äôt let her go because you will regret it. 

Let her be the weird goofball that she is. She‚Äôs gonna wanna dance like theres no tomorrow or until she starts complaining about her feet hurting because she loves wearing cute heels and sexy shoes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard being a girl.‚Äù There may be times when you are walking in the mall or outside and the music is playing, most likely she‚Äôs gonna have the urge to sing it or dance a little too it. NO matter who is watching or how many people are there‚Ä¶embrace it and join her. Be a goof with her. Be weird together. Remember she's choosing to be that way with you and because when you are with her it shouldn‚Äôt matter. Its just you and her and those random strangers watching you are just happen to be in the right place at the right time to witness a connection like that.

She sometimes likes to cause scenes in public‚Ä¶not the scenes you are thinking about. She‚Äôll start arguing over something that is completely made up just to make you uncomfortable and others reactions but she‚Äôs completely joking. You can either look at her like she‚Äôs crazy, be embarssed and walk out or you can go along with it. Don't walk out. Admit that you are wrong in whatever she is yelling about or deny it, but keep going. Whatever story she comes up with to a stranger and includes you in it‚Ä¶go with it. She once told a stranger on our second date that we had a child together‚Ä¶.our story went on for about 15 minutes. 15 minutes of not knowing what the other one was going to add to the story. We still laughed about weeks later. After you walk out you won‚Äôt be able to stop laughing about it. Thats who she is. For most people that could be too much but why? Life is to dull as it is we need someone who is always going to keep it fresh and fun. If you can‚Äôt handle a little embarrassment she‚Äôs not the one for you! She loves it. She can also take it too. 

She is like no\-one I‚Äôve ever met before. In the time that we talked and saw each other I always wondered and often mentioned how I didn‚Äôt understand how nobody could want to be with her and how the ones who had a chance to be with her let her go. Her response was always either, i don‚Äôt know, they all end up hating me or they couldn‚Äôt handle me. So she wants to go out sometimes and close the bar down and dance till the lights come on. Sometimes she just wants to go out with coworkers or her girlfriends. She is a the type of girl who likes commitment and having someone every night but also is independent and needs her own time and space. Chances are shed rather spend the night with you watching a movie or show then going out and partying, but when she does want to go out you have to be okay with it and let her have her fun. She will be back. 

She‚Äôs the girl you want around your friends. They love her. It‚Äôll get to a point to where they invite you out or to do something and they ask if she‚Äôs coming. You can wander off for a few minutes knowing that she is perfectly comfortable talking to your friends and carrying on a conversation without you up her ass and vice versa. She'll make fun of you along with them and even start some of it. In fact its almost like she‚Äôs known them for ever when she mingles with them. She cares about your friends and who they are. Honestly she is the first girl who before she met my friends, when i would talk about them she asked to see what they look like so she knows who I‚Äôm talking about when i talk about them. It may sound stupid but for me that shows that she actually does care about you and your friends.

She makes you feel like you can tell her anything and it feels so good when you do. She‚Äôll be your best friend. She‚Äôll be the first thing you think of when you wake up and the last thing you think of before you fall asleep and everything in between. This girl will drive you crazy. Make you feel like you never thought you could feel. When you lose her you will feel like there is nothing left‚Ä¶and just lost. Don‚Äôt lose her. Don‚Äôt give her away. Love her. Love her hard, every day. Love her for EVERYTHING that she is. The cute. The Sexy. The beautiful. The Funny. When she‚Äôs not funny but thinks she is. The brains. The rude jokes. The insults. The compliments. The weirdness. Her obsession with documentaries. The obnoxiousness. The independence. With make up. Without makeup. The good and the bad. 

Appreciate everything about her. She needs someone who she can be herself around. Let it all out. So when she wants to crank the radio up and sing to a song she knows all the words to or only the chorus, don‚Äôt turn it down. Turn it up louder and sing with her if you know the words and if you don‚Äôt make em up she does half the time anyways. Like i said..dance with her in random public places to that song, be obnoxious with her, have fun with her make her feel that weird is normal. Show people that she is yours, you are that lucky son of a bitch that gets to be weird with her. People will look at you and be jealous of what YOU have, not what she has, but you. She is incredible. Amazing and deep down inside has a heart of gold. She will make you wanna drop everything just to be with her. Drive hours just to spend the night with her because with her its right and she makes you feel complete. You will never live life the same after you meet her, without her it will always be incomplete. She will make you fall in love with her and if she doesn‚Äôt then you don‚Äôt deserve her. 

That girl‚Ä¶..she was my soulmate. She was the one. But now she‚Äôs gone. And she‚Äôs gone before we had a chance. Our situation wasn‚Äôt ideal, we lived 2 hours away from each other and she‚Äôs the type of personality that needs someone every night so that worked against me and although i tried it just wasn‚Äôt enough. Thats why this one hit hard and hurt the worst. It‚Äôs the fact that a connection that her and I had didn‚Äôt mature and grow because of distance. It kills me every day knowing that we could have had a happy life together and we didn‚Äôt get the chance to see it. We can cling to that ol saying that ‚Äòif its meant to be then we will end up together‚Äô but the only problem with that is it could be too late. And that right now is my biggest fear. Its not losing her because that is done. Its her realizing what we had and it being too late to make it work. To the lucky ones after me, appreciate her and love her for who she is. She‚Äôs worth all the awkward moments in public. Theres no other way to put it other than that she‚Äôs pretty fucking great. Like i said when she‚Äôs gone you will regret it so don‚Äôt let her go. Do everything you can to keep her. I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

I don't care if we only had known each other for a few months, what we felt was real. I thought it'd lead to something.. something more than that awkward in between stage of not being together, but not being just friends or just a hookup either. You can be with a person for 3 years and feel nothing‚Ä¶.you can be with a person for 3 months and feel everything. Every time my phone goes off I just pray it's you and my heart sinks every time it's not. I realize that to this day I would still do anything for you. I would have dropped anything and everything on the spot for you, and if I had a .0001 percent chance of being able to have you I would have left my life for that. I'm an idiot for saying all this and I most likely scared you off. I'm not crazy but I may be a little crazy for you. Its‚Äôs only been a few weeks and it feels so much longer than that and it feels weird to know that you‚Äôre somewhere out there and despite all the different ways we used to communicate it like there‚Äôs an invisible force¬†between us preventing us to do that. It sucks. It‚Äôs just weird¬†because everything seems just like a distant memory and you‚Äôre just a stranger again after just weeks of this. I can‚Äôt even begin to think what my life is gonna be like without yo in it still to this day. At the end of the day I‚Äôm just glad¬†I even had the opportunity to ever have met you. If a soul mate was real, you would probably be the one. I‚Äôll always remember you (unless I get Dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs). 

\*\*\*Two months with little to no communication and we ended up together. She moved from her home state to mine and we are currently living a pretty happy life in our own apartment. Sometime's love takes time and space for you to realize certain things....don't ever give up or change who you are. The right one will come along...you just have to be patient.

We‚Äôve shared intimate emotional and physical moments.  Cuddling, sitting in a hayloft in the middle of the night telling stories and laughing, sitting under the stars, a bit of kissing, etc.  We‚Äôve also cried to each other a few times, and had so many emotional relations and intimate moments.

"Hello,
I'm a young midwife and I work in the delivery ward. My boss (around 50 y.o., the head doktor of our ward) is known as a not so nice, overly demanding man. But he was always very polite to me, he was eagerly teaching me the things I couldn't do, since it's my first job. My co-workers were teasing me that he's hitting on me but I refused to believe that, he was acting like a perfect gentleman. We exchanged occassional smiles in the halls, chatted on occassions and that was it. I didn't admit I have a crush on him to anyone, especially him. Long story short, he gave me a short kiss two days ago when we were alone and said ""I would like to continue this, but we work together so I can't"". I left his office without saying anything, I was too shocked. Despite his words he already grabbed my hand a few times or said sth inappropriate when there was a possibilty of being seen/heard. He's in the middle of a divorce right now. 
I don't know what to do, I do like him a lot but I don't want to be known as ""the boss'es pet"". Is there even a way to fool around with him without people knowing?",romance
"She's amazing! Like honestly, she's super funny she's smart, and we are pretty much the same person. She's very physical she is always playing with my hair laying on or against me she's not afraid to joke around with me and I feel so comfortable around her. But I have almost no confidence. Not because I don't like myself (Although I'm not the all that fond of myself either) but because every time I've had feelings for someone I lose them. And she's so awesome i don't want to lose her. I'm scared. Another part of the problem is that I don't know if it would work. We go to different schools and we have our own plans for life so I'm unsure if I'll even see her again after high school, I'm scared to 1: get in a relationship that has a time limit and 2: I don't even know if we could make it work due to the fact we see each other maybe twice a week If we're lucky.

"Hey you guys! Hope you all have been well. 

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve posted something, sorry about that. Sadly, this update is anything but happy. Let‚Äôs dive right in. 

A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with one of my friends, we‚Äôll call her Neptune, about Mars. She had been telling me about her boy problems and how she didn‚Äôt know which boy she liked more between two guys she had been seeing. I felt like I should share my predicament with my crush with her since she spilled so much info out to me. Mind you, Neptune and I are not that close. We‚Äôre close by association but we don‚Äôt really hang out usually. Anyway, I told her about him, showed her a picture and she was like, ‚ÄúOh, yeah I think I‚Äôve seen him around! He‚Äôs cute, you should go for it!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really think much this conversation at the time and forgot about it quite frankly.  

Fast forward to last week and I see one of my close friends, let‚Äôs call him Orion (I‚Äôm running out of planets), and he tells me that he‚Äôs been seeing Neptune and Mars hang out a lot as of late. At first I was shocked. I couldn‚Äôt believe she would make a move knowing that I liked him. After thinking it over for a few hours, I though, ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs not like that for him.‚Äù He often hangs out with girls one on one and it doesn‚Äôt mean anything, so I shrugged it off. But the actions speak multitudes. 

I decided to go out this weekend and watch him play a game. She wasn‚Äôt there and I was a little bit excited. Afterwards we went and got a bite to eat with a group of friends and everything was going well, he was engaging with me, different than before, but it was still something so I was thankful. I asked him and some of my other guy friends if they wanted to hang out later and he didn‚Äôt really say anything so I figured he needed a nap. I took a nap too and then went with the same group of people to go watch a movie. I tried to ask him to come with us because I decided that no matter which way it went for me, I was going to tell him that I liked him. RIP me. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

He was nowhere to be found so we all just hung out and then crashed for the day. The next day was our school‚Äôs fall festival and I was curious to go because I wanted to see if it was all it was hyped up to be. Mind you, it crossed my mind that they might show up together, but I was hoping that didn‚Äôt happen. God must‚Äôve know I would‚Äôve been crushed if I saw them. My friend asked me for help with something and I got distracted and missed the fall festival. Turns out, Mars and Neptune were there and apparently they were the talk of the night. Sigh. 

I know it‚Äôs my own fault because I didn‚Äôt make a move, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt even know if that would‚Äôve made a difference. I will always hold out hope for the possibility of Mars and I dating. I‚Äôve liked him for so long, he has qualities that I see as husband material. He checks off almost every box on a list I didn‚Äôt even know I had. I know he doesn‚Äôt feel the same, so for now I‚Äôm taking a step back. I don‚Äôt think I can even get tutoring from him anymore, it‚Äôll just remind me of the magnitude of the person that I let slip through my fingers. If nothing ever comes from our friendship, he will always be the one who got away. üòî 

I realize that he is not the end of the world and that my story is most certainly not finished. Nonetheless, I am pausing this part of my life to grieve the loss of what could have been. It hurts a lot, but it won‚Äôt break me. I am strong and resilient and I will get over it. I decided I‚Äôm not going to hang out with him or any of our mutual friends for the remainder of the time before Christmas break. I just can‚Äôt handle another sad thing happening in my life. BUT DO NOT FEAR! I‚Äôll be back next year (or before depending on what happens) with more TEA to be spilled ‚òïÔ∏è.

Thanks for being my listeners and friends, 

I appreciate all of you. And I‚Äôll return, I promise. 

Your grateful and a little doubtful friend, the ever changing,
Venus.",romance
"Ever since we started dating, I‚Äôve told my bf that I enjoy all of the clich√© things that girls like in movies. It‚Äôs something that truly sets my heart on fire and makes me feel so special even with the smallest of details.

In the past, I have had guys send me flowers from Japan (I live in Cali) and send me flowers to my house, dedicate me songs, surprise me with random little things that remind me of them, send me letters, and whatnot.... so I‚Äôve been used to always recieveing things like that from guys I‚Äôve dated. 


I hate to compare, but throughout the 10 months I‚Äôve been with my bf he has only given me flowers and surprised me a handful of times. Once on my bday, when I graduated, and only once this time I told him to pick out a flower for me. I appreciate every time he does it for me and I even tell him how much it means to me and how I feel when he gets them for me. 


However, he hardly does it. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm tired of giving him hints of what he should do for me. He doesn‚Äôt understand that I don‚Äôt care about how the flower looks or if they‚Äôre from the dollar store, he just doesn‚Äôt get it. 

Im his first official girlfriend, the other 3 were just girls he was basically friends with benefits with. None of them were like me according to him, as in they didn‚Äôt expect the little cute stuff from him. I told him of course not. I‚Äôm different from them and he needs to learn to be more of what I like. 


Throughout our relationship I feel like i always give more. I have given him my all... literally. I lost it to him and I don‚Äôt regret it one bit. I really do love him, and he knows how much of a big step it was for me and our relationship. On his birthday I surprised him with friends which is something no one has ever done for him. I always pick him up (he doesn‚Äôt have a car rn) and go with him to places like 2 hours away. I always text him whenever I get the chance and ask him about his day and stuff. I always compliment him and tell him how lucky I am to have him.... but i feel like that isn‚Äôt enough for him to understand I need more of that. Our conversations through text are dry, when we‚Äôre out together he takes out his phone although I tell him how much it bothers me . 


I broke up with him once before in the beginning of our relationship because he wasn‚Äôt putting effort, and I feel like he‚Äôs doing the same now. I‚Äôm super sad and I wish he would do the romantic things I‚Äôm used to. It‚Äôs a big part of a relationship for me and I‚Äôve stressed it to him but he seems to forget it. Any advice ?",romance
"There's this girl I met lats June and we got really close real quick. We had so much similarities that is just too fucking crazy to even be so similar. Anyways, we always talk until late at night almost every day and night or from time to time and we had a few video calls. She even clings to me when going to movies and is just being playful with me. We just sometimes have ""dates"" even though none of us had confessed. There's no label in our relationship either. Idk if we're just friends or more. But there were times where I was drunk and she'd ask me some questions about being in a relationship. She heavily implies (and me as well) that there's something more yet we dont have the guts to spill it out. Then on the night of my birthday i get drunk and she let me sleep on her shoulder/chest, stroked my hair and cuddled. But despite those lovey dovey shit we did I sometimes questioned if it was all real since she sometimes brings up her crushes as if she's intentionally doing it and talks about her  makeout buddy sometimes (it sucks but i still really like her anyway). I got my hopes up but now it's all crumbling since she barely talks to me now and she's ignoring my messages. It wasn't like before now. And I really hate. It feels as if we're drifting apart. Her best friends know me now. We're close friends but is there really something more? Or is she just leading me on? There were some red flags and my friends even warned me about her being known as a problematic person in her school yet she seems to be a great person, to me at least. I'm trying to understand her but it seems I'm the only one here who's just initiating the first move. I still want her but idk anymore. It's been a week but she still hasn't replied. I know she's a very busy person since she's a top student and all but if she truly cares, she'd message me, right? She told me that she cares. But i don't know anymore. It's as if I'm only convenient for her when she's bored. Any suggestions on what should I do at this point? I don't want to assume. I don't want to let our friendship fall. But I also want to know what she thinks and feels. Why she's suddenly ignoring me all this time. I can't read her at all. It's just hot and cold at this point. How should I let her know? What should I do?",romance

Below is the result of my attempt at a micro fiction piece. It must be romantic comedy and under 100 words. It also had to include the act of making popcorn and the word respect. Thoughts?

*I sprang from my cubicle as he rounded the corner. Neither of us reached the microwave, and to this day, I don‚Äôt know who smothered my flaming bag of Orval Redenbacher.*

*I thought his chipped tooth added character, and he thought the same of my scarred brow. His mother disagreed. While he respected her opinion, she couldn't keep us apart. Also, Louise, having burnt popcorn didn't mean I couldn‚Äôt cook!*

"Today, over FaceTime I kissed my camera and told my boyfriend of a year and a half ‚ÄúI miss you so much darling‚Äù to which he got uncomfortable and told me that he wanted to stop ‚Äòheavy affection‚Äô. I was confused before he elaborated that our cuddle times were amazing and he loves them, but he wasn‚Äôt comfortable going any further than that. He‚Äôs trans, so I understand if he isn‚Äôt comfortable with me touching him intimately, but this news comes a little late as we‚Äôve been intimate a lot over the course of our relationship. I always ask consent. I would never want to make someone uncomfortable with anything we‚Äôd do in bed. I always want my partners to feel comfortable and to enjoy themselves. Whenever I‚Äôd ask him ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù He‚Äôd enthusiastically say yes. But he tells me today that he only did that to make me happy and he genuinely doesn‚Äôt enjoy sex or making out. He said I never pressured him, and that he only wanted to make me happy so that‚Äôs why he lied. 

I don‚Äôt know what to think. This whole time I‚Äôve been trying to make him feel comfortable and I‚Äôve been trying to pleasure him but he only did anything because I asked him too. I feel like I‚Äôm the worst human ever. Do I leave him? I feel awkward being in a relationship where I‚Äôm the only one who benefits from sex or anything intimate. I can‚Äôt have a relationship with only cuddles, no matter how sweet he is. Should I just accept this? Or should I move on? Regardless, I‚Äôm going to hell I guess.",romance

"I just want to put this question out there for discussion. I [did a post about it](https://jackfisherbooks.com/2018/02/10/do-soul-mates-actually-mates-exist/) on my blog recently, mostly with respect to how the concept of soul mates affects writing romance novels. But after writing it, it felt like one of those topics that deserved a wider discussion.

I made clear in my post that I don't buy into the concept, but I do believe in the concept of a special kind of love that blossoms between two people as they grow together. You might say that's no different than the concept of a soul mate, but that's just me.

What do you all think about the concept? Does it affect how you go about pursuing romance? I look forward to the discussion.",romance

"This girl I've known her for 3 months. And in that time we have become best friends. But I asked her to kiss me and she did. I text her in the morning wishing to have a good day. We talk on the phone everyday for at least an hour. We went on I date the the movies we held hands she rested her head on my shoulders I wrapped my arms around her, and kissed her on the cheek. Her mom loved me and her sister. Plus her friends were rooting for me. Anyway after the date that night I got super drunk and called her and said I love her and really like her and even if she wanted to be friends I would be fine with that. Next morning I woke up to a text saying she wants to be in my life and she loves me and talked about how she has a weird attraction to me and how I was good looking, and the best date she ever had , so good she considers it her new first. but her feelings are jumbled up and her anxiety causes her to feel numb inside at times, and shes been sending mix signals also her feeling for me are to wishy washy and instead of breaking my heart later she doesn't want to lead me on and just want to be friends. I unfriended her on Snapchat to give her space apparently a very bad idea. She called my best friends crying saying she had an anxiety attack. And that I just wanted her for her body and she's so mad at me and she can't do it anymore she's done.

"I met this guy on Tinder during the Qurantine. We have virtual dates, we have meme wars, we have bonded over mental health issues, we are both left-wings, and we share similar hobbies/interests. He is sweet,, supportive, easygoing, caring, empathetic(maybe a little too empathic but that makes me feel more protective of him), and very well-read. i have told him about the emotional abuse that I suffered and he expressed a desire to hold me and console me. I sent him an audioclip of me singing Selena‚Äòs ‚ÄúDreaming of You‚Äù and he said he was touched and that he would save it. I melt whenever I hear him call me ‚Äúbabe‚Äú or his ‚Äúbeautiful princess‚Äú. I look forward to hearing from each day. Whenever I see him smile, I smile.

We have lately gone from saying I'll kiss your cheek to I'll kiss you and we (mostly me) would say how we platonicly love the other but we just stuck with I love you.

The pregnancy made me hormonal and with a weak support system and a number of other emotions I became very depressed. One day to the point of writing a goodbye note to everyone I know.

I saved my boyfriend (now fianc√©) for last. I had been avoiding him to hide everything from him, but he still stuck with me.

"    Well, now's a good time as any to put these three degrees in Creative Writing to good use. 
I am offering heartfelt, personalized cheap valentine notes, letters, phrases for cards, and poems based on **A.** Some
background on your partner/crush provided by yourself so ""stolen or ghostwritten"" becomes a lesser possibility and
**B.** Whatever vibe you're trying to get across: sexual, you are so the one I swear-ish, profound and emotional -
I can do it all; Just ask.

I am more than willing to provide examples of my work so that you can see if the technical craft

I accept payment via Paypal and Bitcoin. The product will be in your hands after payment has been confirmed/received, and within 2-3 days, depending on what type of writing you've requested, you will receive a piece of my heart that is now your heart sent to your e-mail, messages, and so on.

Pricing is as follows:

 * Short note (Like you might leave on a pillow or on a card for a bouquet) **$3 USD**

* Poem (Will be about 3/4ths of a page-- you provide me with circumstances, details, memories; 
All of that. I'll make it happen. Even if your partner is suspicious that you wrote it, I can circumvent 
that by placing a false author name on it-- ""Nah, I couldn't write that. That's just a poem that's 
always reminded me of you) **$10 USD**

* Long Letter or E-mail (I will require some mundane writing samples from you so I can get a sense
 for how you write. Other than that, you inform the general sense of what the content is.) **$16**

I don‚Äôt want to make things awkward",romance
"Okay.. so like the title says my dream girl has a problem yet to be diagnosed - it has been a few weeks now.  She is sweet, smart and beautiful.  She is always on point.. hair, clothes.. and it always seems like she isn't even trying, unbelievable really.  She has had a constant headache for the past months and has gone through tons of testing but the problem has yet to be resolved or even diagnosed.. The thing about this girl is that even though she is in pain she is always smiling and can easily laugh at my jokes and act sweetly when I tease her. Realize I am not dating her, if I were I would know exactly what to do.. flowers, head massages, notes, etc.  I really want to ask her if she would like a quick head massage (since I give good ones for headaches) but it just doesn't seem right and so I haven't.  I will admit that I have had the problem in the past where I did not make a move soon enough - the girl/woman has said I've been waiting for you to do that all night -..  and this makes me wonder if there were times I should have made a move and did not.  But honestly I go at my own pace and what feels right and I think that should be okay.  I broke up with my fiancee about 2 and a half years ago and this girl.. well she is.. When I first met her a little more than a year ago she was out of my league (a big reason I left my fiancee is because I had fell into ruin and became a completely different person during my time with her) and now I think she is still out of my league but I have made vast improvements to myself and the difference between us is much less.  A few months ago I was tongue tied even just talking to her.. this has only happened to me once before.. I could write like this for a while longer so.. what should I DO??!  A note slipped into her bag sounds nice but is that weird?  No girl makes me feel this way and I have dated  A LOT - though not since before my fiancee.  Any ideas would be much appreciated!  Feel free to diagnose the situation I laid before you as well!  For reference I see her 3-4 times a week.  We have gone on short walks together back from class as our homes are fairly near each other.  She constantly smiles around me but I am not sure if she feels anything for me and I am not sure if she knows how I feel.  We text quite a bit sometimes and I have asked her to dinner and to the movies but both times she had plans with her Mom who lives close by so I don't think I those were excuses to let me down gently.  I know I probably shouldn't put too much stock in one person but there has been no one else I feel good about besides a woman I met in Colombia but there are some drawbacks there as she is successful and has 2 kids.. so I would have to be an insta father (which I am not keen on) and she would have to move here or I there.. so no go.

"Soooo....I had a new neighbor move in about a month or ago, and initially I only saw her when walking to my car, taking the trash out, etc. We exchanged ""hellos"" and other small talk briefly but that's it. However, a couple weeks ago I got off work on a Saturday and get a knock on the door. It's her, she stopped by under the pretense of asking a question about the guys that had painted our houses but ended up staying over for about 45 minutes talking and getting to know each other. We both agreed to get up later that night (which we did). Since then, she has been over literally EVERY single night. Nothing physical has happened yet, but her body language suggests to me that she may be into me. I'm really bad at reading things, but her eagerness to be around me all the time and the fact she is either at my place or I'm at hers almost every night tells me *something*. There was also one night when I was gone and she knocked on the door and my roommate answered and she inquired if I was out with ""some girl"". She is really inquisitive and intuitive, and hangs on every word....like, she will remember something I told her in passing from weeks ago that I don't even remember telling her.

We really gel well, she is beautiful, and single. Perfect right? Well, there are a few wrenches in the gears. For one, she hangs out with my roommate too when she's over (obviously, since he lives here), and when she invites me over she feels it necessary to invite him over too (as to not be rude). While he likes her plutonically, he has assured me time and time again that he's not interested in that regard but does value the friendship they have so far. She is aware of the fact he has a constant on-and-off relationship with his ex, and has met her as well, so I don't see her pursuing my roommate. I get plenty of alone time with her but am also scared to make any kind of move just simply because she's my neighbor. If I have misread things it would be terribly awkward and I wouldn't want to ruin a potential good friendship if things didn't go well. But I keep getting signs, and it has me emotionally confused to say the least. She is definitely what you would call a ""good girl"", and I can't picture her making the first move. We've shared our past relationships and talked openly about sex and things of the sort so I know she isn't a ""prude"" per say. Everyone I have talked to has told me she's waiting for me to show that I'm interested and not to expect her to make any moves. I'm just so confused as to what to do.

We definitely have chemistry, and I'm aware that if she didn't like me in some way she wouldn't be hanging around all the time. She has gotten more flirty, personal, and physically playful as of late but I am terrified of making the wrong move. I mean, maybe she's just really friendly? I don't know. Normally I can read these situations pretty easily, and most of the girls I have dated/been with have made their feelings obvious after a period of time, but she's different. I'm physically and mentally attracted to her equally. If my roommate wasn't around so much I think it would be a lot easier to gauge, but I can't say. All I know is I'm definitely catching feelings and I don't know how to approach it with this girl. I want to lay it on the line about how I feel so I don't miss my chance or seem like I am not interested but also don't want it to be too premature and scare her off. I'm sorry if this post has rambled on, any advice on what signs to look for or how to approach this somewhat delicate situation would be appreciated. Cheers to all",romance

"Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 2 years. We usually never fight not have issues but when we do, they are never easy. Our fights never get physical or anything but they always end with me crying and feeling pretty crappy and blaming myself. We don't have many problems in our relationship except for the fact he doesn't sleep over my house and we both have trust issues. We have come far on our trust issues but it feels like we are slipping back into them. In regards to the sleeping over, I live alone and he is more than welcome over. He used to sleep over frequently and now its like pulling teeth to even talk about it. I would be more than happy to spend nights at his but its not an option as his living situation doesn't allow it. I have tried to communicate my feelings towards it but always get met with the same answers. We both have crazy schedules but have always made time for each other and done cute things for each other. I noticed things start to change toward the end of spring and feel as though the effort is not the same. It almost feels like I am getting half if not less at points than before. I miss a lot of the little things he would do for me. I miss the small notes and gifts. I miss the cards and the texts telling me how much he loves me. I miss the reassurance and the actions to match. We both have been through so many things together and a lot of firsts and this is the first time I have felt like this.

After finally picking a wallet and getting food there was still hours left until we had to catch the train back home so I suggested we go for a walk in the forest, this forest had a massive hill in the middle that was a clearing, you could get a truly beautiful view of the town from up there and so we decided to sit down and talk. Eventually evening came and the sky became a pinky sort of colour, the sky was mostly cloudy except for one massive hole in the cloud formation which just so happened to be right above us. We lay down there and gazed at the stars above us, we lay there for around 2 minutes in total silence until our hands slowly interlocked and we held each other's hands still not saying a word.

He was a complete sweetheart however he use to be very inconsiderate (When it gets cold midday and im wearing a tshirt and his wearing a hoodie and jacket he doesnt offer them) and many sequences which I have let go.

However i was speaking to my friend and she said i should let go of him after these incidents have occurred:

\- He told me to shut the fuck up when i was crying hysterically in his car and was driving me home intending to just drop me there and leave until i asked him why he was in a bad mood.

\- He dumped me for 2 months (March - April) to 'find himself' and insisted he was out of love with me.

\- He has kicked me out of his car after I got mad that we couldn't eat after watching a movie (we were right infront of the restaurant). Basically whenever we plan a nice date full day, he always cancels half-day because his family said 'this' 'that' and to chill with them instead.

\- On my birthday, instead of spending the day with me he went to a sleepover with his friends.

PS: And no he isn't cheating as he always snaps his whereabouts and we both have our locations turned on, on snapchat!

"She was trying to finish an entire semester worth of Political Thought in a matter of three afternoons. Of last minute preparations, she was the fucking queen. Pushing with irregular kicks a big stool to sit on, and a small one to rest her feet on, she proceeded to her small but cozy L-shaped balcony. The sun was a welcome friend to beat the winter nip.

With her back to the wall adjacent to her door, she comfortably positioned herself, and picked up the first chapter, ten pages roughly torn from a spiral binding, held together firmly by two staple pins. One could read Plato only for so long, she looked up to scan her eyes through the houses of the society facing hers. Clothes drying outside balconies, children playing, women talking across balconies, nothing caught her eye. She tried to bring her focus back to wise old Plato. Abruptly disturbing her short spanned focus came her mother into the balcony with a glass of buttermilk, her favorite afternoon drink. She drank, as her mother proceeded to hang clothes to dry.

She began looking at the houses, and a peculiar potted plant caught her eye, it looked vaguely familiar, yet odd. She asked her mother about it, who did not seem to be able to place it.

She continued to study till the sun was out, after which she went inside and nothing interesting happened to her till the next evening.

Next evening, she went outside to accompany her mother who was out drying clothes, an everyday feature, when the peculiar potted plant was made very interesting by the man behind it, watering it. Fair, bearded, penetrating eyes and an uncanny, mysterious handsomeness. He was the kind of man your mother warns you against. It began raining soon after, and she went outside, only to be welcomed by the view of four bachelors standing in that very balcony. It was strange, as hardly any residential society rented out to bachelors. But, who was she to complain?

She didn‚Äôt see him for the next couple of days, much to her disappointment. She told her mother, who she was very close to, who banged the latch of the balcony door three times and laughed it off, saying that the guy will be out in a matter of seconds, and walked back into the house. Her laughter hadn‚Äôt yet died and the man was out in the balcony, with a sleepy face, rubbing his eyes with a confused look on his face, looking at her. She couldn‚Äôt believe he actually came out to the sound of a door‚Äôs latch.

And it began.

In a matter of days, it became their signal, their call, and he would go out whenever he would hear the door latch bang against the hard metal of her balcony door. His door was only wooden, so he would cough instead, and she would go running out, and they would stare at each other for hours, pretending they were just hanging out in their balconies, unaware of each other‚Äôs presence.

Days turned into weeks, and their affair deepened. A persistent cough, a door latch banging, followed by hours of time spent in their balconies where would pretend to be out for a smoke, and she would pretend to be enjoying her playlist whilst walked to and fro. Every time she would turn while walking, she would catch a front glimpse of him, looking at her, with a tension between them that one could slice through, only to find a passion that could burn anyone who came in between whatever they had.

Soon they had the confidence to stare straight into each other‚Äôs eyes, and she felt as if he was looking right into her soul, she felt a raw, uncontrollable emotion she couldn‚Äôt quite name.

It surely couldn‚Äôt be love, as she was dating this one guy who had caught her attention for years.

The boyfriend came over one afternoon, and as they sat out in her balcony enjoying the warm sun, the mysterious man came outside and looked at her. He went back inside as fast as he had come out, and she couldn‚Äôt understand why‚Ä¶ was he jealous?

If he was, then this affair was too far deep to be reigned back in.

She spent a wonderful day with her beau, who before taking her leave, pulled her into a warm embrace as they stood in her room, and left her with a kiss on the lips. As they parted, she realized her balcony door had been open all along, and ‚Äòhe‚Äô might have witnessed her with another man. She ignored the thought, she hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong, and went downstairs to see her beau off. While walking back up to her apartment, she saw him sitting on the boundary wall of his balcony, look at her and then look away. In that moment, she realized he had witnessed her hugging and kissing another man and was upset about it.

She went out in the balcony, and hoped he would look at her, but he didn‚Äôt. She coughed, but he didn‚Äôt look. She decided, two could play this game. Armed with a small blanket to keep her from catching a cold, and her stool, she went and sat outside. It was a long night, he was upset, and she was guilty. They both stayed out the entire night, ignoring each other, in the bitter cold. He didn‚Äôt budge from his spot on the boundary wall, nor did she, except for the occasional stroll. After some five hours, into the early hours of the morning where the sky was still dark, he got up, went inside, and then she saw him leave the building. She felt she did her best to make up for what had upset him, without using any words. She cried herself to sleep at night, torn in her heart about what she felt, and for which man her feelings were stronger.

She woke up the next morning, only to find him sitting with a girl in his balcony. She felt jealous, but guessed she deserved it. Her mother, who had been witnessing all this, felt that enough was enough, asked her to call whatever was going on, off. The very thought brought her to her knees for he had become a part of her day, her night, her dreams. Every afternoon while returning from college, she would look up before entering her building, to find him looking at her from above, she would spend hours walking in her balcony in the evenings, for that one look of him which she would catch when she turned to his side of the balcony.

It wasn‚Äôt just her though, she was a part of his day too. He would leave for his job every evening and cough before he did so, for she would come in the balcony and he would see her one last time for the night. As he walked out of the building with his friends, he made sure he was the last to leave, so he could look up at her balcony, into her eyes, and not have his friends notice it. He didn‚Äôt want them to see her, she was his.

The mother was firm, it had to end. So she went outside, coughed, he came out, and with a signal of hands, she conveyed that they could no longer continue what had gone on for so long, as she was in a relationship with a guy one could not flaw. He looked surprised at first, since she was attempting to make conversation. Till now, all their volumes were spoken only by the eyes. His expression soon turned to that of sadness, and he went back inside. So did she, but not before she had broken down in an ocean of tears. Days passed by, and she didn‚Äôt see him in the balcony. She saw his friends, but never him.

This one cloudy evening, fate gave her another chance to make a choice. She saw him standing in the balcony, his back towards her, smoking a cigarette. She went outside, no longer was she in charge of logic or reason. She was far behind any rationality, and in too deep. She prayed for him to turn, and just as he did, their eyes met. She signalled him to stop, and he did, and watched her hold her ears to ask for an apology, which he ever so readily afforded her, by smiling wide at her. Their saga resumed.

They no longer pretended to not acknowledge what was happening between them, and they started straight at each other every evening. He never left for work without seeing her once, till this one particular evening.

She had gone to the market that evening, and knew that he would be waiting for her. As she walked back to her building, she saw him, on the road, outside a cab, taking to the driver. Their eyes met, he smiled, entered the cab, and went his way. She then realized, this affair had transcended attraction, it was so much more than that. He couldn‚Äôt leave without seeing her.

A few evenings later, as she was walking in her society, she saw him in his classic red hoodie, as she approached the main gate. Her pace slowed, as did his. He was only a few metres away from her, separated only by a massive iron gate. Neither could gather to courage to move towards each other. What would they say? They had experienced everything a traditional relationship does, a meeting, their own language, flirting, jealousy, a short break, and a rekindling of the same romance, which had only emboldened them.

What does one say in words after having said so much without them? Their relationship had transcended words, it was unique, extraordinary, and neither wanted to jinx it. Their bond was surreal, and words would make it all too real.

Came New Year, and he got drunk, very drunk. He walked out in his balcony and coughed. He shouted out, asking for her to come out. He kept shouting hello, and asking loudly why she wasn‚Äôt coming out. It pained her to see him like this, and all she wanted was to do as he asked, but was afraid, as it was past midnight, and had she gone, who knew what else he might say.

All this while, her heart was drowning in guilt, for she loved someone else too, in a different way, but it was love all the same. She didn‚Äôt mean for any of this to happen, and she didn‚Äôt know what to do. She made a choice after moistening many tissues, courtesy her swollen eyes, and chose her boyfriend as the one she would stay with. But her mystery man was making it difficult for her to stay true to her decision, so she dropped a letter to his society‚Äôs office, complaining about the drunken ruckus and drug use the bachelors staying in their society were indulging in.

She couldn‚Äôt take it back now, she had cut the cord on their affair. She watched his friends carry luggage and their precious plant into an auto and leave, and he wasn‚Äôt there. She went to college the next, and came home to find her mother with the most extraordinary story. Her mother had heard a lot of coughing from outside, and upon going out in the balcony, she had found the bachelor pacing about in his balcony, looking at their balcony. He had apparently waited a long time, before eventually leaving. She broke down again, she didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye, and he was gone.

Come next morning, she heard a cough. Afraid to get disappointed, she stayed in bed. Hope got the better of her, she got up, put on her spectacles, and ran out to the balcony, to find him standing in his. She cried, and he saw, and they stayed that way for some time. He then went back inside and so did she, unsure of what to do next. She was deeply attached to him, and it made no sense, for they never had had what one might call a real conversation.

A couple of hours later, she heard a cough, and ran out, to find him standing inside his room, the window ajar. His friend was standing alongside him, considerably out of view. They looked at each other, with pain in their eyes, for their relationship was moments away from its end. He stared at her, taking in the last look to last him for all days to come, and his friend had to nudge him from his daze, the window had to be closed, they had to go, and I had to be left behind as a love with no name.

Reluctantly he slid his window shut, as slowly as he could manage, never taking his eyes off her, as she stood, praying for time to stand still. She knew she would see him leave the building for the very last time, which he did, but he did not look up. He just walked away.

Maybe they lacked the courage to make themselves a possibility, or maybe they had the courage to let go. They were far beyond what words could achieve, and they would have done no good. Where would they have gone from there? They knew nothing about each other, not even each other‚Äôs names, but they had still loved each other in their own twisted way, and felt all emotions any great relationship has to offer.

Not all love stories reach their happily ever after. They just are, magnificent in their fiery passions that burn bright but never forever.

And to think it all started with the darned cannabis plant that had caught her attention as she struggled to read what wise old Plato had to offer on one very ordinary winter afternoon.",romance

And none of y'all best be tellin me to just ask him. I couldn't even tell H I wanted to kiss him without almost having a panic attack!

Will light up the entire place with artificial battery operated candles. I am planning a small table with a flower pot near the canopy and a couple of wine glasses. A friend will bring her to me and I will ask :)

Will have some light music and I am right now working on my proposal speech. Will take pictures of the thing and share if feasible.

The next morning he walked by me and said hello and he ended up introducing himself in the pool. We started to hang out and ended up sleeping together in his room. The nights went on and we started seeing each other every single night we would walk around the ship and talk and get ice cream, sometimes go to his room, but towards the end of the week we were catching serious feelings for each other it was like we were practically a couple, we would walk around the ship holding hands and kissing and cuddling . We clicked really quickly. It was the last day and we were practically in tears having to say goodbye considering I live in Ontario and he lives in Washington.

"Cold and ruthless, without holding back‚Ä¶ Well, this was the way he did things.

Fine. After all, she was in the wrong here.

Qingmang took a deep breath and got a grip on her emotions. Pursing her small mouth, she whined to him softly, ‚ÄúLu Yanmu, it hurts‚Ä¶‚Äù Her voice was filled with self-pity.

If she wanted to change everything that had happened in the past, the first thing she had to do was grab this man and never let go. Right now, the best way to pursue this would be to show some vulnerability.

The man was slightly surprised to hear this, astonishment flashing through his gaze, itself as deep as an ancient well. He recovered in an instant, though, and then showed nothing else on his ice-cold face.

After taking a moment to digest this, he finally said, ""Where does it hurt?"" His voice was as rich as aged wine, laced with sex appeal.

Qingmang could tell that he was surprised, and she could understand why. She would never have acted so spoiled toward him in the past life as she did not like how controlling he was. Thus, she did everything she could to piss him off. She never knew where to draw the line.

Now that she was starting over, everything was going to change. Besides, the man standing before her now was the person who loved her more than anyone in the world.

Qingmang stared straight at him with her bright and clear eyes, pouting. ‚ÄúMy hands hurt, my feet hurt, my face hurts, my head hurts. Everything hurts‚Ä¶‚Äù

And yet, the physical pain was nothing compared to the agony of her past life.

Whenever she thought of the revelations she had experienced just before she died, her heart jumped out of pain.

Lu Yanmu narrowed his eyes slightly. Borrowing the dim lamplight from outside the factory, he gave her a skeptical look. Gu Qingmang‚Äôs current actions were making him very cautious.

However, when he saw the distinct slap mark on her face his dangerous and repressed aura of violence suddenly erupted.

‚ÄúWho hit you?‚Äù His voice was as cold-blooded as an asura‚Äôs, making a chill run up your spine upon hearing it.

He could not bring himself to raise a hand at his woman, no matter how angry she made him, so who gave those bastards the guts to hit her?

His sudden air of violence gave Qingmang a shock as well. No wonder her face stung a little.

She lowered her gaze and mulled it over for a moment before she pursed her lips and motioned at the group of thugs. ""There, it was them.""

Actually, she knew very well that they were not the ones who had slapped her. It was only later that she found out the shocking truth of the ploy behind her kidnapping. 

When he heard this, Lu Yanmu turned around and glanced at them coldly, his gaze carrying a bloodthirsty chill that made them squirm. They hurriedly said, ""It wasn't us! That mark was already there when we caught her‚Ä¶""

To be honest, they were also hooligans who lived on the seamier side of the law. Nevertheless, they could not hold a candle to his sheer presence, and so they could barely get a word in.

They were being accused of something they did not do, but they could not even defend themselves convincingly. Where was the justice in that?

""Hoh‚Ä¶"" Lu Yanmu looked at them, his lips curving into a smile.

Unfortunately, those familiar with him knew that he was even more terrifying when he smiled.

He was intimidating when he did not smile, but when he smiled, it was like the calm before the storm.

Qingmang quietly mourned them. When someone made Lu Yanmu smile, it meant that they had well and truly pissed him off.

And those who pissed him off usually met with tragic ends. 

As expected, the secret guards standing beside him made their move before he even said a word. They cleaned the thugs up as though they were merely handling old marionettes.

Suddenly, the two of them were the only ones left in the gigantic factory.

Lu Yanmu turned around slowly, his ice-cold gaze piercing through the dim light before landing on her slowly. It was cold to the bone.

When Gu Qingmang sensed that gaze on her, she could not help but utter a silent ‚Äúuh-oh‚Äù. Was Lu Yanmu planning to punish her now?",romance

I heard my mom watching some bad comedy sketch on Facebook (I know, already off to a great start) about how the elderly/family/etc pictures always told a story, whereas the kind of stuff you see on Instagram (i.e. food, selfies, etc) do not. This popped up in my head about a month later and I thought about how absolutely untrue that could possibly be. Yeah, sure, most of the time it might not have substance, but what about the times there is?

‚ÄùHey, Grandma, why did you take a picture of your dinner?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, this? Oh! I remember that! That was at a hibachi restaurant with your grandpa! At the time, this was our third date, and...‚Äù

‚ÄùDad, why‚Äòd you take a selfie of you in a suit?‚Äù ‚ÄúFunny story, actually. I was trying on a suit for my first date with my first boyfriend, and I wanted to see how I looked. I was really nervous that I was going to look stupid or say something weird, but...‚Äù

‚ÄùHey, Auntie Anna? What‚Äôs this selfie with you and Uncle Pat?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, this one was from when we went on our second date at a coffee shop! It‚Äôs funny, really - most people go for the coffee shop first, but the first was a carnival - anyway...‚Äù

"We took a two day break from talking due to me being busy. We FaceTimed again last night and we got really deep. She told me all about her ex and some problems she has. She seems to really be opening up. At one point I said ‚Äú _____ I really like talking to you because honestly I love studying and learning about you as a person‚Äù she then asked why? With a smile. I then said ‚Äú because your upbringing is so much different and the more I learn about you the more intrigued I get. She paused with a big smile and looked me in the eyes and then said thank you _____ after several hours we both got tired and we agreed that we should talk more because we both enjoy it. I said i felt like she was good for my soul. She smiled and said me too. She thanked me for talking to her and helping her with her problems. We then agreed that this summer we should hang out. I said we‚Äôll cross that bridge when we get there and she smiled. The whole time I felt fuzzy inside. She said she‚Äôs never felt true affection and that she craves it. I think I‚Äôm in love

"So I met this girl 6 years ago on a school trip and honestly that‚Äôs where it starts. We will just call her ‚ÄúC‚Äù. When we were getting our luggage from the airport, my friend had asked me to go with him and talk to this girl he was interested in. At the time I didn‚Äôt have any interest in anyone and didn‚Äôt have anything better to do so we went over to go see her. Standing next to the girl he was talking about was the girl I haven‚Äôt been able to get out of my head for the past 6 years. We went up to them and I introduced myself, then something kind of amazing happened. They looked at each other surprised then looked at her bag and on her bag was a sticker with my name on it. To this day I still think of that as a sign and I always wonder if she does too. Anyway so that‚Äôs how we met and we became friends after that but I wanted to be more than that. Throughout the first year of knowing her, we got extremely close. We bonded through her cute ‚Äúman‚Äù voice when she had lost her voice and the movie camp rock. One song in particular actually, from camp rock 2, Introducing me by nick jonas. I promised her that I would learn that song on guitar and sing it to her. So I spent countless nights singing that song and trying to figure it all out and I would send her little parts of the song just so she knew I was trying. I don‚Äôt think she ever fully grasped how hard I was trying though..yikes. Anyway, at the end of the first year I told her how I felt and everything and she said she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship which was understandable because we were young so I just decided I‚Äôd wait for her. We stayed friends and the second year nothing too exciting happens. But then high school started and I had lost hope that she would ever really like me back so I started dating for the first two years of high school. Those relationships didn‚Äôt really work out even though I gave them everything I could I think when problems started to happen I didn‚Äôt try to fix them because I was hoping it wouldn‚Äôt work. I still wanted ‚ÄúC‚Äù. So junior year comes around and I start really talking to her again and we have a thing for a little bit. During which I held her in my arms while we were on my couch and normally it‚Äôs whatever but with her it felt right in its own way. Ps I am not a hugger usually because I find it hard to be emotionally available to people. So holding someone that wasn‚Äôt a family member or girlfriend is a big thing for me. Also in this same year, summer before junior year of high school, we made bracelets. Well, at least she helped me make my bracelet because I‚Äôm not very good at it. In any case, I told her I was never going to take it off unless it breaks. Fast forward a summer, I still have the bracelet and I have some of my friends over who are trying to take a pillow from me (Two of my close friends that are female). They can‚Äôt do it but one of them clips my bracket and breaks it. This actually like gave me a pain in my stomach and I got very upset for the day but I didn‚Äôt want to make my friends feel bad so I just tired it to my backpack and told ‚ÄúC‚Äù that we needed to make a new one. So we meet make a new one and then something happens that nobody thought would. The friend group that had stood the test of time, started drifting apart. We all had jobs that started getting in our way and new friend groups. So now senior year starts and I‚Äôm still talking to ‚ÄúC‚Äù and I‚Äôm still head over heels for this girl but she doesn‚Äôt know the extent of what I feel. After I told her how I felt, we started talking more again until I found out my best friend since preschool liked her too. This was a crushing moment but we agreed we should all just be friends. He has a very short attention span and really is just looking for anyone who will give him attention so she wasn‚Äôt anything special to him and he moved on from that moment. For me though, this was different and I still haven‚Äôt moved on. Now it‚Äôs the summer after senior year, I haven‚Äôt talked to her since school so I decided to text her. I sent her a picture of the bracelet and told her this one was getting pretty tight on me and I might need a new one. I get a text back and we start talking. I ask her what‚Äôs up and how‚Äôs everything going, only to find out she has a boyfriend who isn‚Äôt going to the same college as she is and they‚Äôll be in different states completely. I don‚Äôt know if they plan on staying together or what and I haven‚Äôt met him so I don‚Äôt know what their relationship is like. I still have butterflies when she says my name or I see her name show up on my phone and I have never once seen anything negative about her. I leave in two weeks and I almost don‚Äôt want to see her before I leave because that‚Äôs the hardest goodbye I‚Äôll have to give. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll tell her that I still feel this way or not because I don‚Äôt think she has even thought about me as anything more than a friend in a while. Sorry for the book, I needed to express myself a little.",romance

Then it leads me to think that maybe I‚Äôm not good enough for these boys and that I‚Äôm ugly. Thoughts saying: you‚Äôre fat. You‚Äôre not skinny enough. What‚Äôs with the acne? Maybe they‚Äôd like you if you had an ass. My self esteem is already low and with that, it‚Äôs adding more pain.

Maybe the fanfics and books have gotten to my head that I‚Äôm living in this fantasy of falling in love and being with that person forever. 

All I know is, I‚Äôm a curious child. I‚Äôm envious of friends sometimes because they have something I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm too ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù to understand. I have to stay in my shell while they roam freely.

"KHAROLYNNE 


As I frequently do, I entered the Midnight Lounge, ordered my usual drink a chambord cocktail and began to look around. Before I took my first sip I noticed an unusual dark silhouette in the corner. It stood confidently and by its graceful and feminine movements, I could tell a beautiful woman hid behind that shadowy mystery. She is the one today I thought and so I gathered my drink and thoughts, and walked towards her. Ernesto the bartender smiled and winked at me, he knew me so well by now. When I stood directly infront of her she was already greeting me with a smirk and careful eyes. ""You look stunning, mysterious and......you're not drinking anything? whats you're name pretty""?  She said nothing and just looked at me the way someone looks at a piece of unusual art. We exchanged gazes which meant we exchanged thoughts. When you carefully look into a woman's eyes she will reveal things to you. In this exchange her eyes told me she was happily taken. The smile that slowly accompanied, told me she appreciated the compliments because now she felt prettier. After our silent quick conversation I turned to walk away. ""KHAROLYNNE, my name is KHAROLYNNE "" she said. I smiled at her and walked back to Ernesto for an encore beverage.

"Bf (m35) and I (f30) went engagement ring shopping and although I did not want a solitaire we ended up buying one. The process itself went smooth and although I was hesitant, as I did not want a solitaire, the thoughts of being his wife, starting our life together, and the international symbolism of that solitaire won me over. 

Then my feelings changed even before we left the parking lot. While we were purchasing the ring he mentions he could have spent more money, explaining that while he doesn‚Äôt have a problem spending money on iPhoneX (which I would never dream of doing so) he does with the ring. Then while in the parking lot, again he tells me that he could‚Äôve spent more money. At this point, I tell him, ‚Äúbabe, please don‚Äôt tell me that.‚Äù  

He makes good money and just from his perspective, because it is between him and I, I felt cheap or undervalued. I‚Äôm a pretty frugal because I spend responsibly and don‚Äôt consider myself a materialistic person at all, but his comments made me think twice. Between the both of us he is definitely the spender. It also doesn‚Äôt help that his mom once complimented me on my ‚Äúcheapness.‚Äù

Are my feelings valid? Or, am I just being too sensitive. The more I think about it, the more I think these feelings may be rooted in our financial security as a couple, and how we choose to spend money and hence place value on things. ",romance

"We‚Äôve been together for four months, but it already feels like it‚Äôll last a lifetime. I moved in with him last month and have not since looked back.

He‚Äôs not necessarily a romantic person, but it doesn‚Äôt stop him from trying. The first time he awkwardly handed me a gift with a mumble of ‚Äòthis is for you‚Äô made my heart literally leap high into the sky. In my life I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend that gives me presents (small things, not expensive, which I find even sweeter), that actually does something if I ask, and strives to make me happy. 

He may not be perfect, but he‚Äôs the closest thing there is. I seriously contemplated our future and I am not breaking out in a cold sweat whenever I think of marriage or babies with this man. This is a first for me. 

He truly cares for me. I feel respected, yet protected. I even feel loved. Outside of my immediate family, he is the most important person to me. I love him so much. I strive to make him as happy as he makes me, but it never feels enough.

I‚Äôve never been as happy as I am in this moment, as I think of him. I then feel sad as I remember I am flying back to my home country for a month to see my family. This was planned before we even met. I will miss him so much. He said he will miss me too. He‚Äôs coming with me to the airport and is going to stay with me until I need to go through security. 

I wish he could come with me, or at least visit. We were planning a weekend where he could come and meet everyone, but he just got promoted in his job and is still settling into his new role. We have decided *together* that we will book a weekend in September, when kids are back at school, and we can go to a hotel somewhere and do some tourism while he gets to know my parents.

my dad went. there, i met two guys, we'll call them B1 and B2. so they were both older than me by a year bc i was the youngest camper there. i ended up talking to B1 about memes here on reddit (specifically cursed comments) a lot during meals and we had the same friend group through the week. if im being honest, i had a slight crush on him but nothing real. he was very souless though. i only became friends with B2 a few days before camp ended and he kind of annoyingly followed me around, to the point where i would make an effort to avoid him in a way. however, he was still really nice and respectful. but i also got really close with one girl right before the week ended. we'll call her M. she was on the same swim team as B1 and B2 as it was a large team very close by. she also happened to have a huge crush on B1. she was the one to tell me that she thought B1 had a crush on me. i have never really been someones crush before, so this was a shock to me. later thet night, while all the girls were hanging out in the dorms, i was talking about how annoying B2 could be when they said he probably liked me. this again was a shock. keep in mind that i live 13 hrs from the both of them. i got B1's snapchat and we dont really talk, besides the occasional meme. however, M doesnt know about my slight past crush and we are still close. i have a crush here at home too, which only the girls at camp knew much about. i still like him a lot, but now im distracted by the other boys. camp was only 3 weeks ago.",romance

"Obligatory I'm on mobile disclaimer

So I met this girl in a workshop event about career planning. We sat next to each other because it was our assigned seat. In a free time, we talked quite a bit about each of our career plans and a bit about our past. It was a good talk.

So a week after the event, just now in fact, I messaged her and it went like this:

(This is a translated convo)

Me: ""Hey, you like cats and ice cream?""

Her: ""Hmm, yeah. What is this about?""

Me: ""I kinda want to go to this cat cafe. Maybe you want to join [me]?""

*Silence for 20 minutes*

Her: ""Ohh. Hmm. I want to.. But too bad.. My parents don't allow me to interact with cats..""

Me: ""Ahh haha okay then.""

Her: ""umm, I'm so sorry. Maybe you can ask your other friend to go with you.. :)""

Me: ""Haha it's alright, relax üòÅ""

Her: ""Okay then..""

So, it's not a hard no.

At first I want to check this cat cafe out on my own but then I thought I could invite her and kill two birds with one stone, get to talk to her more and be close friends or whatever. I'm kinda interested in this girl as she's real fun to talk to, just to clarify.

Also, this is the first time I asked a girl out in a long time and I've never been in a relationship in my whole life.

Should I keep trying to get close to her and invite her to other places later or should I just let it go? I don't want to come off as annoying or creepy.

I'm 22 yo and, in my country, it's common for people my age to still live with their parents.

"So I've been best friends with this girl for a long time now and I've been in love with her for about a year now. She's everything I could ever want. I asked her out months ago and she said she didn't want a relationship at the time. Recently we got a lot closer, and she finally opened up about her insecurities. She said she never really feels like she's enough and I wonder if this is why she doesn't want a relationship. I say this because she's generally affectionate with me (never affectionate with friends), even mildly cuddly if I'm lucky, and always acts different when talking to me, like she's more excited or giddy than usual. I may be wrong though, as this sort of thing has happened before (with a different person) and it didn't go well.

So how do I(20 female) know if i'm in love or just want to be closer friends to someone?

He's a istp (19 male) that we are close friends even though we don't talk much.I think its due to working together in school projects most of the time and i did ask him face on if we are close friends. I've known him for 3 years but deep inside,i know i'm not really that close to him since i don't know anything about him outside from the time i meet him in school.Usually this doesn't bother me with friends since i'm not sure if i want to keep this bond between him alive after graduation(I've only have 2 friends which was kept with low effort since they live far from me and they are usually busy so we don't do meetups like at all but we do keep in contact a few times per few months and it doesn't feel like we have grown apart so far)

Nowadays,i had this want to keep this strong friendship even after graduation and it doesn't help that i have 3 separate dreams where i was chatting real excited like an extrovert to him alone and the feeling was always warm and fluffy like although i don't feel lust towards him.I frequently check my ig story and see if he did saw my story and each time he saw my story or liked my post,i would feel slightly happier than my other friends since its like he noticed me in a way.(I dont usually feel this way when my other friends liked or saw my post) I've also felt embarrassed when talking about romance with him alone vs me being confused by people's dumb action when 'in love' with other friends in a group.I also just had this want to know more about him in terms of how he thinks,how he see the world etc just recently and am giving some of my time within reasons to hang out with him and if possible alone so that i can ask more personal questions and know him more face to face.I find it hard to hang out or talk to people without a purpose so this is a first for me to ask personal questions and trying to find reasons to see him face to face and talk to him more.I find myself jealous or sad when he talks and have more physical contact to his other male friends more compared when he talks to me sometimes because i want to be that guy when he talk cause he feel more in his comfort zone than when talking to me.I also like the sound of his voice,i do think he's cute although i don't strongly feel those warm fluffy feeling that i have when i'm in love with a franchise or book.But sometimes i had this feeling of just holding his hand,hugging,being in close contact with him and even kissing him like what couples do although there's no lust feeling whatsoever since i'm bored of porn(its like watching animal zoo tbh)

What i want from him is not a couple status although i do think its nice but i want him to feel that i am trust-able to the point where he's isn't afraid to talk to me because of his own fear,society or self expectation etc and i'll like to do the same for him. I've also come to my own conclusion and is sure that he's an istp(even though i didn't ask him to do the mbti quiz since i want to know more about him first hand) and done some reading on how to catch his interest,talk longer,predicting what he like and putting it into action.

I'm so confused even though i do read what being in love is like but it just doesn't feel right.Mainly because i don't feel lust towards him but i want him to accept who i really am when i do expose my inner self and i want to do the same for him.

So what do you think?Am i in love or just want to really be friends to him in the long run?",romance
"It‚Äôs a loooong story but I feel like I could use some advice so here goes nothing.
My fianc√© and I have been together for 6 years and engaged for just under 5. It was literally like a week before the 5th anniversary of our engagement that he broke it off. 
We hadn‚Äôt been intimate in 2 months, and not for my lack of trying (or begging). I could feel him pulling away, and I tried a sexy maneuver. He shut it down and told me we needed to talk. 

Now some back story; my fianc√© suffers from mild agoraphobia and a pretty severe anxiety disorder. He‚Äôs held a job for the last 2 years and is going back to school to get his GED, he even has his own car now. But for the longest time I had to take care of him, at the expense of living my life. And I knew this going in, I did it because I was so in love with him nothing else mattered. I never once made him feel like I resented him, because I didn‚Äôt. My philosophy was that if you can‚Äôt handle the bad times then you don‚Äôt deserve the good times. And let me make this clear, when it was good it was so good. Like the movies. When it was bad... you get the picture. 

So he says he wants to take a step back, he feels like he‚Äôs dragging me down with him and that he needs to get his life in order before we move forward. And on some levels I get it, I really do. He‚Äôs got old school values, he believes the man should be the protector and provider and he feels he hasn‚Äôt been that for me. He‚Äôs about to be 28 and still hasn‚Äôt made anything of himself and hasn‚Äôt achieved his dreams. So like I said I get it. What I don‚Äôt get is why that means we had to break off the engagement. We weren‚Äôt in a rush, yes I have been bringing up that I wanted to talk about setting a date but nothing was set in stone and I wasn‚Äôt being pushy. We‚Äôd been engaged for almost 5 years, and now he has doubts? It just doesn‚Äôt add up to me. I would be inclined to think there was someone else but here‚Äôs the clincher... he only goes to work and school and comes home. He never goes out without me. He doesn‚Äôt have time. He‚Äôs too tired to go out. Etc. 

We‚Äôre still together and trying to work on things, but it‚Äôs been a month and I think I‚Äôve made up my mind. I‚Äôm going to give him just under a year. If we aren‚Äôt re-engaged, or haven‚Äôt made significant progress by 1/1/2020... I‚Äôm done. I love him with every fiber of my being and I‚Äôm pretty sure it would kill a pretty big part of me to do it but I‚Äôd leave him. I owe it to him and myself to see if this thing can work, I‚Äôve put so much effort into this, being there for him, being his comfort, and loving him that I just can‚Äôt throw it away. But ever since I‚Äôve come for this decision I feel different. I still love him the same and all those statements are still true but... it‚Äôs almost like a weight has been lifted off me. I can‚Äôt imagine my life without him in it but lately I‚Äôve been thinking about it...Making plans about what I‚Äôm going to do when it happens...thinking about being single...
I feel horrible and relieved at the same time. 
What do I do? Am I doing the right thing? I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore...

"Hi! I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl interning at a company and I‚Äôm under a 29 year old guy who delegates tasks to me.

My friend was much more quiet and so the conversation was largely between the both of us.

"""Violette""


The kettle is whistling at me, letting me know that my much anticipated tea is ready. A small gesture from her part that brings a smile to my face. As I sip my tea,  another beautiful creature of the same essence  comes to mind......Violette. You see,  just like Violette the kettle is decorated with beautiful features. Rainbows, flowers and a sunset are illustrated on its cylindrical body. The arch that makes the handle is a clear substance with delicate little streaks of pink. Just a decoration? Not to me, what I see is inspiration, that particular inspiration that comes from the beauty of feminine energy. I like to think that the artist just like me had a keen eye for beauty. That the artist came  across his own Violette, and  that she stopped him dead in his tracks and stole his breath. At the same time she gave him the inspiration to create this kettle that at the moment is serving me my tea. The thought makes me smile. Today I will see her, oh Violette.... and I think she knows that I've already started an affair with her in my mind. Yes, she is married. Happily? Oh I don't know. Emotions are fickle they change day to day. What I do know is the look of unfulfillment in the eyes of Violette, curious eyes. I look in her eyes and see a thunderous storm at night time. You know, the kind with heavy rain, and a dark purple sky. Beautiful..... Violent winds and bright streaks of thunder illuminating the darkness. A storm that warns everyone to run for shelter..... but not because its dangerous but because that is all the storm knows and she is used to it. Oh Violette I am different. I will run outside and bathe in your violence and gaze at you're streaks of lightning with a smile on my face. I will stand there drenched for hours until your storm dies down. Then I will kiss the top of your head, and then hold your fragile little hands and unleash the wrath of the beautiful masculine. The thought makes me smile. I unplug my kettle and put my cup away then I head for the door.",romance

"i used to like someone when i was about 14. i liked him since i was 14 till 16, we were the same age. it was a painful yet innocent love story with many heartbreaks and tears. it took me about a year to get over him when we parted ways. 

fast forward to 2018, i was in a new school and i made new friends. one of friend was close to this friend (also in my class). me and the boy weren‚Äôt close until the end of 2018 when he invited me to a christmas party, together with the other friend. few days later, he invited me, the same friend and another female friend of mine to a carnival. some stuff happened afterwards, lots of drama happened. it was very childish and it involved him.

2019 came around and we‚Äôve started hanging out more often with another group of friends, which still includes both my friend and my female friend. i‚Äôve started to grow interest towards him and i think i‚Äôve started to like him. but i‚Äôm scared of liking someone now, especially after the guy i liked for 2 years. 

i‚Äôve also noticed that he always talks and tease with my female friend and i‚Äôm afraid that he likes her and she likes him. whenever i see them talking i get really jealous. i know i shouldn‚Äôt be but that‚Äôs just how i feel. i tell myself to get over this infatuation because my heart cannot handle this jealousy. but, he still treats me really nice and also cares about me (i think?) 

i‚Äôve only like him for close to 2 months so i don‚Äôt want to confess or anything yet. i‚Äôm a real sucker for guys that care for me so maybe it‚Äôs just an infatuation.

now i just need advice on how i should get over him without making things awkward and still continue to be friends with him. ",romance

"I‚Äôm having a bit of a dilemma...
So I have this guy friend and we‚Äôve known each other for a couple of years but this entire time I‚Äôve never thought of him in any other way but a friend, I mean before this year we weren‚Äôt even that close, we still aren‚Äôt that much. He‚Äôs had a gf and bf and I always thought he looked cute together with them, but recently this new older girl transferred to our school and we became friends and one day she that there was a girl that he liked, and it was pretty much just a joke but I was acting as if I felt sooo shocked that he told a new friend about his crush than me or our best friend. I asked her who it was but she wouldn‚Äôt tell me, instead she gave me hints. Short, brunette, a girl...  and by the way my friend was acting and the hints she gave I was scared that it might have been me... but I quickly brushed it off because I thought that there no way he of all people could see me like that...Is what I thought...
So me and my best friend confronted him during the last period as she was too shocked  that he told someone else before us and he got all surprised and immediately rushed over to see our friend who was in another class and when he came back after awhile he went and sat in a corner just, sulking. Our best friend goes and talks to him a bit and I go over there and all I manage to hear is something like him saying that he already told our best friend and he gave her that annoyed look that said he did not want to be in this situation anymore. So we left it. 
Until later that night when my bff ft me and told me not to be weirded out but the person that he liked was me. I kind of knew but I also didn‚Äôt really want it to be like that, one because he feels like a distant cousin or a brother or something, like I just could never think of him like that, another reason is... because our best friend also likes him. 
So we are now stuck in this love triangle situation where he likes me, she likes him, I like the thought of just going back to friends but that can‚Äôt happen ohhh nOooo. And this all happened months ago but... my guy friend he is technically the definition of ‚Äòmy type‚Äô 
Tall, lanky, brown hair, white, so i may have thought about him in... peculiar situations but I always felt guilty but recently, I‚Äôve kept having these thought more and more and I‚Äôm so confused and idk what to do. This all just seems so annoying which it is cuz I just want to have a nice guy friend who is just that, a friend. I don‚Äôt want to date him I don‚Äôt want to have any romantic or sexual attractions towards him. What makes this situation even more complicated is that I also have i guy I like... he basically already rejected me and I haven‚Äôt seen him in months but I can‚Äôt help but think about him... he is also just my type but it‚Äôs not just that, he‚Äôs funny he‚Äôs not that smart but that‚Äôs part of his charm and he‚Äôs so nice, he always remembers what I tell him even the details, I can‚Äôt help but like him more and more. I think I‚Äôve read somewhere that if you like smoke for more than 4 months that means you love them... could I be in love? Or is this just a delusion that my teenage hormones have made me think. I don‚Äôt really know what true love is and I‚Äôve never experienced it before but I can honestly and wholeheartedly say that I really like him and miss him and these thoughts of my guy friend are just annoying and I feel so guilty... pretty sure no one will read this wall of text lmao oh well at least I can finally get this off my chest.üòå",romance

"The names in this SHPEEL have been changed, I'm not ready for them to know...

I went to that old social center years ago(FUCK I feel like I've been on Earth FOREVER), and met another ""crew"" with which I deeply identified. It had felt like a long time since I had that, I NEEDED it... &lt;3 Years later, I arrive at the newer social center, meet ANOTHER ""crew""... Mary and Kevin, then Jessica a bit later... I fucking LOVE these guys, REALLY feel at HOME with them... Now Mary and Kevin, they likely hurt me deeply, DESTROYED me, when they got a tad close while Mary and I were together. I'd say the backlash from me RIGHTFULLY getting suspicious was -ironically- MORE detrimental than the actual affair that likely occured. ONCE AGAIN, my emotions mean JACKSHIT to the people in my life... :'( Sometimes, that hurt melts away partially... Mary: She's been POWERFUL in her supporting and growing of me, she fucking LOVES me. Even some of the times I fucking HATE her, I recall her motivated, supporting, STRONG-in-the-face-of-adversity character... Kevin: I see his heart, it means SOOO fucking well, CARES, even when he's a bit of a dick. He's just, such a fucking CUTE softy at his core... Jessica: I find myself ENAMORED with her emotions, and her expression thereof... The way she puts her HEART in her singing, her ADORABLE, GENUINE expression of deep care and concern for people and things where she's cutely like ""awwwww"" about it or something to that effect... *chuckles* Then oddly enough, there's MYSELF(autoromanticism -and autosexuality- for the WIN): I've been through SO fucking much, BECOME so fucking much, some of which is so strong, and PIERCINGLY beautiful, I'm in tears typing about it at THIS moment! FUUUUUCK!!! How about we two couples become a QUARTET... I'm such a fucking CUTE, LUSTFUL, PASSIONATE, little thing! We all are... We... could REALLY use this... We owe it to ourselves and one another to BASK in each other's PASSION... These thoughts and emotions make me feel more ALIVE than I've felt in YEARS(""Awake and Dreaming"" by Laura Brehm plays POWERFULLY in my heart and head while I contemplate what we could BE to one another)... Damn, last night I dreamed the 4 of us were having a conversation. *siiiiiiiigh* Kevin and Jessica were so TANTALIZINGLY nearby, and I KNEW it was a dream, so I got closer to them -while bringing BOTH of their faces closer to mine- and started PASSIONATELY kissing both of them. MY GOD, it felt amazing... I WANT them, perhaps NEED them??? Such are the perks of having dominion over most others in my dreams, I think it's because they're mere mental MODELS of real-life people that house part of my OWN consciousness... &lt;3

P.S. Half-disregard this WHOLE thing: although it's based on real emotions, but they're half-exaggerated(save for the emotions about ME). *chuckles* I guess I just DIDN'T want to lose them, you know? I don't feel like losing yet MORE people, and I truly LOVE them... THIS was my last, desperate mindfuckery to feel connected to ANYONE. I no longer feel connected to A SOUL(I ended up remembering I feel quite connected to ""The Main Soul"" at times, so pehaps I'm ok?), nor do I feel like I ever can again.

"So I (17, almost 18 F), have never been in a relationship--not counting the time i just held hands awkwardly with a guy for a couple weeks when i was in seventh grade. I'm a senior in highschool, and starting last year I've become...enchanted with the idea of being in a relationship. I'm asexual and therefore have no interest whatsoever in a sexual relationship, but I really want to just date someone and do couple things. It's probably because I see couples around my school campus all. the. time.

My 18th birthday is in two days, and thinking about it makes me think about the fact that I've never been in a relationship before. All of my friends are in relationships, and they're super happy. I probably would've had a relationship by now if I got out more or put more effort into my appearance, but apparently it's also because I'm so oblivious to romantic advances that I wouldn't know a guy was interested in me unless he straight up told me.

Last year one of my friends confessed that he liked me, but I turned him down because I didn't like him. I had no idea he was attracted to me, and it really threw me off guard. And then recently, a friend of mine was talking about a guy who was apparently trying to let me know he was interested in me based on his body language and whatever, and I had absolutely no idea. It was so obvious that a third party saw it, but I couldn't.

Another reason I haven't been able to get a relationship is probably because I haven't had a crush on anyone in a good 5 years. I think it's because I don't allow myself, but I honestly don't know. I've had a couple short crushes (a couple days) recently, but both guys turned out to be gay, and one was taken. What are the odds, right? Anyways, I don't really know what to do at this point except hope that I'll find a guy when I go off to college and that he'll like me back. Whatever.

"  

What is my love for you?

It‚Äôs not something I can easily explain. I‚Äôve used the flowers as a metaphor but still even then it does not accurately depict what I feel. This love I hold for you is one of simplicity and purity, one that comes without effort. With it comes a child like innocence, for when I‚Äôm with you I nearly forget about the rest of the world. This love is something I know won‚Äôt die, for its not a fleeting feeling. Its one that is constant, and given the chance this feeling could grow into something truly beyond my own comprehension. Yet is this what true love can be? Are these feelings fabricated out of nothing, or are they rooted in something deeper that has not rose to the surface yet. These are what go through my mind when I get lost in your stare, the eyes are truly the most powerful thing a person can have. They show your intention and feeling even when you are unsure how you truly feel. The eyes are the windows to the soul and I‚Äôve never seen eyes like yours. You‚Äôve said you don‚Äôt feel the same, you love me as a friend and as a person, but the way you look back says so much more. I feel as if I should give up hope, yet something in me begs to hold on. You are such a rational and understanding person and I‚Äôm lucky to be with you in this regard, I long for more but am able to find solace in where we are now. For I can spend hours with you, just listening and talking, your company is one I never want to lose. Part of me feels you are my soulmate, but how can one feel like that and not the other. Is it dormant? Something that may awaken in time? I feel that answer will come after the London, there are answers there that will change whatever is between us for better or for worse. All I truly want is you happy, and if this is what it takes then continuing down this path I will. The path will change in January.",romance

I left for a different state, but I didn't let her go‚Ä¶ Well, I never let my friends go, and things here have been worse than what I tried to leave, but the point is the girl. This isn't the first time I wanted her while I was here. If anything, I don't think this is my first post about her here‚Ä¶ But if anything, after what girls have put me through here (I never dated one, but one's trying to get a restraining order for something I didn't and would never do), I keep looking back with an emptiness. She's never given me a problem, and she's one of a small group of people I could trust.

I'm not moving back, and I leave for boot camp in August for 13 weeks (Parris Island, US Marine Corps), and I'll be in Florida for six months for AIT (Aviation Mechanic is going to be my job). I don't know why I still want her. Sure, I never met a better girl (as far as I've lived), but she's on her way to college and I'm on my way to the military. I don't know if we'll ever see each other again.

If I'm able to, I plan on going to my old school's prom. I want to see my friends again, and if I can, I want to get just one dance with the girl (even if I don't want just one). Other than that and graduation, I think that's it. I can't see us seeing each other again, but I can't help but think of what could be. I want her, but I don't know why. I want her, but I don't want to want her (if that makes sense). I miss her, sure, but I miss plenty of other girls (and guys) that I don't want to hold hands with, let alone kiss.

I'm completely lost. What is all of this supposed to mean? What do I do?",romance
"So I go to a community college and as I was walking to class, a guy stops me asks me if I was in the performing arts department. I say no. Clearly mistaken identity. I continue walking and he has more to say. He‚Äôs was nice and told me I was pretty. He asks me for my snap (I have no social media) and I say I don‚Äôt have one.

"I'm new to Reddit and have been truly fascinated by this community so I figured I would give it a try. I have a real life situation that I feel I've fallen into. Where to start. In 6th grade I met a boy, he was sweet, we talked and eventually started writing notes and letters to each other just back and forth. He was my first crush ever. We were preteens so I didn't think too much of it. One day in band I got an announcement on our pa telling me to pack my things I was going home. As I walked past the courtyard to the front of the school I passed by him. It was pure luck. We exchanged letters that we had on us yet again without realizing it was the last time. I looked cold so he gave me his jacket and said to give it back whenever. Unknown to me.. I got in the car with my little sister and my parents told us to get comfortable and that we would be on the road a few hours. Later we arrived in Austin in a new home. I cried. I read his last letter wrapped in his jacket and never felt so betrayed by my parents and lonely.
Time passed and in the start of high school we connected on MySpace. He found my name and sent me a friend request. I was happy again. At one point our friendship felt so good that I wanted to ask if he would be my long distance boyfriend and we could see each other when I would visit my aunt and uncle in his town where they all lived. Where I used to live.. But I backed out. I was too afraid of the response. We talked on and off for years. Both graduated high school. And in 2012 I broke up with a boy I had been dating for two years. I reconnected with my friend and we talked for a while and everything seemed great. But we fell off somehow. Later in 2013 I tried to message him through Facebook and got a nasty response from a female saying that he was about to get married and have a kid that was not yet born. So I left it alone and cried to myself thinking this was just life.
As the years passed I would get messages on Facebook from him asking how I was and we would let each other in on our lives. We talked about his marriage and his son and the many countries he visited while in the army. I had been in a relationship and living situation with a man myself so we were both growing up.
Now.. At this point it has been almost fifteen years since knowing him. I greatly consider him my best friend. I feel as if I can trust him completely and with anything I tell him. I got a message one day saying he wanted to talk to me about something so we did. He was unhappy in his marriage and was depressed. The advice I gave him was to simply do what is best to save it for the sake of his son and if he didn't feel happy after a few months then talk to his wife about it to work it out so that their son doesn't see how his parents are unhappy. It really affects children. He did so and months passed when he told me it wasn't working. He tried and tried and nothing. So he left her while making an agreement for divorce and a settlement of money he would send monthly as well as how often he would visit and call and face time their son. I wasn't happy that it was the result, but that's life.
As for me, my six year relationship is already at an end we are waiting to have the money to get our own places and move away from each other.
So around the same time me and my friend both are single and talking again. He's still going through his divorce and I'm still living with my ex until things are resolved.
The problem here is I am afraid at this point. At the beginning of the year we met each other for the first time since that last day in 6th grade. I no longer had his letters or jacket.. When he met me in my town we walked and talked. Ate a pizza. He is so handsome and still as sweet as ever. This past month during our talks and video chats he has said he loves me while both drunk and sober. He drinks with his brother which isn't a problem. But I'm worried because he says this over the phone but not either of the times we have seen each other. After our first encounter we met again when he drove almost 7 hours just to see me. No other reason. And no one has ever done such a thing for me before. It felt very romantic and like he really cares enough about me.
Now.. We feel the same about each other and have said this both through text and face to face. And I'm worried that while we are sorting out our situations we will fall apart over the possible six month or longer wait. I've always loved him and I almost feel like we have a magical story that spans over a decade. I'm not sure if I can still trust him in the same way I did as a kid. We're adults now. And as much as I love him that doesn't mean I'm not scared of what might happen or if I can even really expect a man to wait at least six months to be with me. Will he even wait? Or run after a woman in a bar?
Really the reason I posted this is to see what other people think of the situation. I kind of feel bad.. I mean he's still married. I'm still living with my ex for the time being. Are we wrong for this? Was I the cause of his failed marriage? Can I even trust him after all this time to be 100% honest and real with me? No relationship has ever worked for me and this is causing me to panic. I honestly don't know what to do about it now. I would be crushed and broken if this didn't work out simply because I feel as if he may be the one. We have seen each other twice this month and it has been very mild. We have kissed but nothing more. When we kissed for the first time it's like time stopped. I didn't want that moment to ever end. Now I'm left feeling like a pathetic hopeless romantic saying that I feel like I've found the one. Yet I'm so scared and worried that I may be over thinking the entire thing. When all I really want is a secure feeling knowing that I won't need to worry and that I can trust him. There are no guarantees. That's my story.",romance
"I‚Äôm not the type to do this, nor am I the type of person to continue to pursue someone after breaking it off. But, I fell hard for someone I was dating for 4 months. I know it isn‚Äôt much time, I‚Äôm surprised I even fell this hard for her but long story short:

These 4 months were great. We really clicked, we constantly texted throughout the day and even held multiple conversations at once on other apps (we would always share memes, posts and videos). 

We became really close, we both are busy individuals so we saw each other on the weekends. We would go out to eat and visit many places together. We had many amazing dates and everything was going perfect. We really got to know each other. Till this day, we know each other really well. 

We shared with each other our past dating life and experiences with one another. There was a special connection between us that we both identified. We would hang out, watch movies, cuddle and sleep over. In general, things were perfect and we became intimate after some time. We shared amazing moments in bed, we would always discuss how great it was

Everything went well, except for some small moments where we clashed. It was only three times. Each time was because I overreacted in a situation that didn‚Äôt make things better. I have a bit of a temper, but nothing ever got out of hand. I said some things that only made the situation worse but nothing too crazy. Each time we got over it and moved on. 

But after the third time, which happened through text, she told me to leave her alone and ignored me for 3 days. I apologized and gave her space in hopes of making things better. On the third day, I decided to send her roses with a special note attached which she received and then contacted me. 

They were really nice ‚Äúluxury roses‚Äù which were expensive but the price didn‚Äôt matter to me. She told me how much she loved them and appreciate them ( to this day she sends me pictures of how the roses are blooming). But she told me afterwards that she would rather be friends instead because of my temper. It‚Äôs something she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with in the future and she believed it would continue to be a cycle that she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with. 

I understand her position, given her last history with guys who really hurt her. Learning from her last experience, I tried to be the opposite of the guys she‚Äôs told me she‚Äôs been with. My temper really messed this up. After the second time, I started taking anger management classes which was something I never told her about because I thought at the time it was embarrassing. But that‚Äôs how far I went to maintain the relationship we had. We never established a formal relationship, but we agreed to terms of only seeing each other and not talking to other parole. Which worked out well the entire time. 

It‚Äôs been a few weeks since we broke it off, and we‚Äôve continued to talk and remain friends this entire time. We still text constantly, and the conversations are still great because we are very compatible. We‚Äôve seen each other a few times too since then. We still go out to eat and go to the movies together since we‚Äôre both movie junkies. 

Sometimes we discuss what happened from time to time. She tells me how she doesn‚Äôt want to keep it going because she feels it‚Äôs going to happen again. And she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with it anymore even though she still has feelings about me. I revealed to her that I have been seeking help fixing my temper. I‚Äôve made big improvements but I can‚Äôt seem to win her back.

I‚Äôve dated many women in my life, but I never fell for anyone like this. She consumes my thoughts, there‚Äôs nothing more I want in the would then to have things back they way they were. I fell head over heals for this girl. 

What could I do to win her back? I feels like there‚Äôs something I need to do, trying to sweet talk her back isn‚Äôt going to do the trick. I know how she is. What makes the situation easier is that we are still on good terms, I‚Äôm texting her as we speak. But I really need to win her back!",romance
"So I was sitting with my 2 best friends and chatting about normal stuff. There were 2 nice looking girls in front of us. Then, one of them came up to me and asked me if the other girl was cute. I ignored cuz I believed it was a troll since i'm one of these 16 yr olds that are always in the corner lol. Then, I akwardly looked at her and said ""u talking to me?"" She said yes and yeah since the way she talked seemed like a troll I decided to troll too and said, yeah she's cute but I deserve better. (I said that cuz I was too shy to go and speak with her) Then she laughed and told the other innocent looking girl that I rejected her l. She didn't seem too happy, then she stood up and kissed my best friend as she was watching me and tried to make me jealous then they left. I was like HOLY SHIT DUDE I DIDN'T KNEW I LOST A CHANCE TO KISS A GIRL. So then, me full with regretful of doing we followed them, and they saw was and said ""hey you with glasses *laughs in a sexy way* are you following us?"" I lost my words again and instead of saying something cool or romantic I said ""ehm no just passing by"" then they left...I'm so mad at myself for not having courage to talk to a girl, like i'm always too shy and losing words...please give me advice or something I wanna stop being like that..",romance
"So I had this guy I was seeing for 6 months. After a couple of months I'm, we started to get romantically involved. We went on dates, I hung out with him and his family. It was exciting and scary at the same time. One day I towards the end of the 6 months I asked what were we. That was the comment that sparked everything to end. He thought that I had expectations which I did, and he got distant. Eventually I was to hurt and embarrassed with my feelings and ghosted. 6 months later he gets into a relationship. I was hurt because I felt that it was just something about me. 2 years later I'm still hurt and think about the situation and cant help to think if he thinks about me or the situation aswell.",romance
What about all the lonely people?,romance
"So I‚Äôve been dating this guy for about 6 months, and we have been having plenty of sex. We both tested negative the last time we got tested. I got tested before having sex with him and tested negative. He got tested before we started talking, and he also tested negative. 

Here‚Äôs the thing: we are planning on getting tested again, but he suggested to start using condoms after getting tested together. We already had the talk about keeping things exclusive and decided to explore our romantic and sexual interest monogamously. Given that we both haven‚Äôt been using condoms since we started having sex and we‚Äôre not seeing other people, I find it odd that he would suggest that now. To me, it implies that he might have sex with other people or that he‚Äôs worried that I might. There‚Äôs already a sentimental value to not using condoms aside from the fact that it feels better. We already spoke about this, and how that made me feel.

I‚Äôm aware that a person can catch an STD through other means; he doesn‚Äôt do drugs, for instance, and I don‚Äôt think he will engage in any sexual contact with another person (kissing, oral etc) 

Btw, we‚Äôre both gay men.

Any thoughts on this? Should I be worried?",romance

"A couple of months ago I was in a relationship with a nice girl 1year older than me. We have a lot in common. 
I had met her through a dating app. We first chatted with each other using the app a bunch of days then we started calling each other every evening. And our conversations would last for hours and hours. To a point where I was way too tired when I get to work. I finally met her in person and I spent some nights with her in her flat. 
I was supposed to spent only the weekend at her flat. Cause then I'd have to go back to work and it was in a relatively far away town. I ended missing two days ( the enterprise I was in was very nice with those kind of things, I just did not got paid for those two days ). So to sum it up I spent 5 days with her. 
I got back home just before night time. We called each other as we used to do. For hours once again.
I went to work the next day and I had to catch up all the work I did not do because I was with her. So as you can expect I was even more tired getting back home than usual.
And the phone call we had this evening was significatively shorter. 
And it lasted for the rest of the week. 
The weekend I went to see a close friend of mine who had invited me to meet his new girlfriend for dinner. And this evening while I had told her I would not be available to phone call her she still wanted us to talk. Once I got back home I called her ( it was 3am approximatively ) she told me she wanted a break up because she felt that after we spent time together I was more distant.
I honestly at this moment wanted the same thing. I thought she requested too much from me and the 5 days we spent together were not really good I felt bored because she did not want to do some activities with each other. 

And now since 2 or 3 months I want her back. I feel like those times together even if we just did chores at her flat were really good. I miss her so much. My friends told me not to text her and I don't know what to do anymore.

I apologise if it's not completely clear. English's not my first language and I don't live in an English speaking country.
Have a nice day and thank you if you read it entirely.

Xiao Wei was temporarily stunned, and she exchanged glances with Zhao Xiyuan. His expression was unchanged, but a hint of confusion flashed through his eyes.

It seemed she was not the only one who felt that Gu Qingmang had changed.

Xiao Wei raised her head and gave Zhao Xiyuan a bright smile. ""Don't worry, Brother Xiyuan, I'll watch over Qingmang and make sure nothing happens to her. If there's anything, I'll be sure to tell you. Why don't you go back first, then? I'll stay with Qingmang.""

Zhao Xiyuan's gaze shifted to Gu Qingmang, who was walking ahead of them. He found Gu Qingmang's actions inexplicably odd today. Her attitude was totally not what he had expected.

However, he had known Gu Qingmang for so long, during which she had always stuck to him like glue. Therefore, he hypothesized that her unusual behavior today must be a result of her injuries.

After comforting himself with this, he nodded at Xiao Wei lightly. ""Qingmang's a little innocent, so sometimes she doesn't even know when she's hurt. Please watch over her and inform me ASAP if anything happens.""

""Alright, I got it. Don't worry, I'll care for her with all my heart. You don't have to worry."" As she said this, Xiao Wei covered her mouth with her hand, flashing him a naughty smile.

Zhao Xiyuan was slightly older than them, and he knew a tad bit more about how a girl‚Äôs mind work,s so he did not say anything else. After thanking her for her trouble, he chose not to linger and immediately left the school.

Xiao Wei watched him leave and then stared at the direction Gu Qingmang had headed in, her expression shadowy.

She really hoped it was just as Gu Qingmang said, and that she was just feeling under the weather. Otherwise, all of her efforts over the past two years would go to waste.

After Xiao Wei left, a man who had been hiding near them the entire time took a phone out of his pocket and pressed a few buttons to send a message. Once that was done, he walked toward Gu Qingmang and continued to tail her.

‚Ä¶

Gu Qingmang carried her things and stood in front of Lin Suqing's door. Then, she stretched out one hand to knock on the door.

About half a minute later, she finally heard some noise from inside. The door was opened, revealing a palm-sized face and a head of‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ rather messy hair. 

After opening the door and seeing Gu Qingmang, Lin Suqing seemed to jump in shock. She took one step back and took a second to recover before she lowered her head and asked in a rather panicky, uneasy voice, ""Did you‚Ä¶ come here‚Ä¶ for something?""

Her reaction did not surprise Gu Qingmang. After all, they usually barely even interacted, and now she was at Lin Suqing's door. Anyone would be taken aback. Nevertheless, Gu Qingmang gave her a smile. ""May I come in?""

Lin Suqing was slightly dazed. She hesitated for a moment and then poked her head back inside for a quick peek. Her expression showed that she was quite torn.

Qingmang was in no rush to break the silence either. She simply waited at the door until Lin Suqing spoke.

After a long time, Lin Suqing began to feel bad, so she slowly replied, ""Okay, please come in‚Ä¶""",romance
"So earlier this year I decided to join a dating app. I have never used one before and was pretty much desperate at that point. 

(I have worked through a lot of stuff sense then and I now know that at the time I was really craving friendship and an escape from loneliness. But at the time, I had that confused with needing/wanting a boyfriend) . 

I joined an app. Set up my profile. Swiped through some prospects. I found a guy. He was cute and we matched. I sent him a funny message and suddenly the ice was broken. 

We talked for awhile about simple stuff like how our day was going and what we planned to do after college. One day I was in class and we were snapping back and forth. It got a little flirty and long story short he asked me if I wanted to have dinner at his house that night. I said yes. 

We meet up and I was so surprised at how handsome he really was. I couldn't believe he wanted to talk to a girl like me. I was beyond nervous. We have dinner and get to know each other a bit more. He asked me why I was on the app and I said that I really didn't know, mostly just curious. So I asked him and he said he wasn't looking for a girlfriend at the moment. Mostly just trying to date. 

I wasn't exactly hurt by that because we had literally just met that day. After dinner we suddenly ended up on his bed listening to music and making out. He asked me if I wanted to have sex and I told him no. Part of me was really starting to like him and I didn't want to mess it up by having sex right away. He asked me why, and for some reason my spazzy brain decided to make a joke and say, I'm waiting until marriage. 

It totally killed the mood but....I never told him that I was joking. I dont know why. I just said it and kept it out there. He took me home and asked me on another date in a few days. My heart was so excited because I thought I had messed it up. 

A few days later we go for lunch and he did a complete 180. He barely smiled at me, our conversations were empty and it actually ""felt"" like he didn't want to be there. When he brought me back home I tried to goof around with him a little and he was not having it. After that date he ghosted me. I wasn't heartbroken because I barely knew him but for some reason that brief situation we had stuck with me. 

Fast forward 5 months to now. I just moved into a new place with some people I met through a roommate match service. Me and one other girl were moving in around the same time but oddly enough we kept missing each other because of school and work. 

One day I woke up from a really late nap and walked into the kitchen and saw a familiar looking jacket hanging by the door. You guessed it. 

My new roommate was the girlfriend of the guy I met from the dating app a few months back. I was filled with anxiety and hid immediately as they came into the room. After that day.  All she talks about is how sweet he is to her. How he cooks for her and refuses to let her clean. How he introduced her to his parents after 5 days of knowing each other. 

She always goes around the house basically on my shoulder all the time like my boyfriend always wants me to check in with him so he knows I got home safe. He screenshots my funny pictures I send him. He is so amazing. 

I know he was never my boyfriend and we were barely anything. But back then. It was like he treated me completely differently and for some stupid reason it has me looking back at that time wondering. What is so different about her. Why couldn't you have been that person for me? Did I do something wrong?

I dont know. Maybe because this odd and weird situation has come back and I have a front row seat for it, that it's making me have issues with my self worth.  Just had to get it off my chest.",romance

"So there‚Äôs this guy from my old school, we never really talked or anything but we recently saw each other and we started texting.

He drops all these hints like telling me I‚Äôm cute, saying he thinks about me and all those stuff. We were never really friends before‚Äîjust classmates. But since we started texting we just got much closer and tbh I think I‚Äôm starting to fall for him.

There was this one incident where he made our friends believe we were dating or smth when they asked him cuz he just avoided the question (he told me this himself btw). And when I act shocked he just questions me and asks why I am so shocked since we were dating, weren‚Äôt we? This of course leads me into panic mode but then he just brushes it off and say he‚Äôs joking.

There are a couple of other similar incidents to this one that just makes my heart race. He knows things abt me when I never even noticed him much back when I hadn‚Äôt moved.

But then... he hasn‚Äôt texted me for a month so I‚Äôm thinking maybe he was just toying with me? Suddenly he just goes quiet and doesn‚Äôt talk to me again which just sucks cuz I was just starting to believe we were going somewhere.

I know it‚Äôs been a minute and I apologize. I‚Äôve been trying my best to live in the moment and just experience life, especially with Mars. 

Over the past few weeks, Mars and I have been texting pretty much every day and he‚Äôs been tutoring me and honestly, I thought things were going pretty great.

" Hi guys. This is my first entry here and, I decided to make an account in this place because I would feel very embarrassed to say this in front of another person. I 'm a 25 years old girl. I always focused on my hobbies and being a successful woman. Don't consider myself unattractive but not so beautiful. 0 experience in love. 

 Had cancer two years ago. My family left me alone. I was unemployed, my best friend died at that moment, it was a disaster. I didn't want to disturb anyone, so i decided to face it alone.

One day i discovered a facebook page referring to my favorite video game. Everything normal at the beginning, jokes and memes. It sounds absurd, but it's funny how something so small keeps you alive in the most difficult times. Time passed. I overcame cancer. Everything was better. When I saw that one of the administrators of the page was upset about something, i encouraged myself and drew a picture for him. So far, i think he is an important part of my life. So i wanted to make him happy, even if it was something momentary that he could forget later. 

One day I decided to talk to him privately and become his friend. He's kind and funny, more than  expected. We have some things in common. i continued writing to him from time to time.  he sent me a song. When i heard it, i found myself identified and .. FEELS! i told him how much he means to me. Since then, i think, i began to have feelings for him. He strives daily and wants to improve himself. That, definitely made me love him more. 

I think he's not interested in me. So i leave all of that aside and continue without bothering him. 

When I decided to post a picture of myself, he became interested a bit. Then I showed him a nicer picture, and suddenly I found him very interested. Actually that made me happy but  it seems that is the only thing he likes about me. I decided to confess and apparently it is reciprocal. I cannot believe it. So we decided not to advance until i see him in person to confess properly. 

Although, sometimes he shows disinterested. I'm not really the kind of girl he likes. I like him a lot, so i don't want to seem creepy by harassing him with unnecessary questions. He is a busy person and i¬¥m too, but i can't get him out of my head! I want to go through the stupid forest to go see him and hug him!

I even see him interested in other girls, but really, I dont want to give up. 

I know that's selfish. But i feel so insecure in those moments that i dont know what to do. Help!!!",romance

"So basically straight to the point; I loved a girl. I still do... somewhere in my heart I believe if you truly did love someone it wouldn‚Äôt go away. But anyways, this girl that I treasured with my entire being broke away from me about 6 months ago and that time period was probably one of the hardest moments of my life. And I struggled with it for about 3 months, before I met another girl (nothing romantic) that reminded me that there really are ‚Äúother fish in the sea‚Äù per se. And I completely thought that I was ok and for about 3 months after that, I was living my best life with no other romantic affiliations or any trouble in that aspect. But just last week, the original girl told me that she actually had developed some feelings for me in the past month or two (although we hadn‚Äôt talked much?) And I told her that I couldn‚Äôt deal with the pain that I almost definitely knew was going to come and thought that it would be best to stay friends. Now to the present- I saw her today and what I felt, had been quite irritating and confusing. The process leading up to it was just as confusing as I kept thinking of what I would do with her or how she would think of me and my heart kept skipping a beat when I thought of it. And when I did see her, I couldn‚Äôt help but get a bit annoyed when I saw her acting super close with another guy friend that came along.

Now my crush, Mars (not his real name), is a year below me. Yeah, yeah, I know, weird. But he‚Äôs a super cool guy. Back in high school, him and I would chill because he was pretty dope. I guess you could say that‚Äôs when my crush started. 

Fast forward a few years and here we are. Both in college. He‚Äôs still a year below me, but it seems to matter less now. He and I roll in similar groups, so we hang every once in awhile. I wanna win his heart, but I‚Äôm not sure how... I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm documenting it so that you guys can follow with me and I can have some support. 

Let me tell you about Mars. Mars is tall, light skinned, super talented and goofy. Mars has dimples and an auspicious nose. Mars has curly hair and smiling, warm, inviting eyes. Mars  mocks me but he doesn‚Äôt mean it. Mars has a face etched by Michelangelo himself. Mars has the kindest heart I have ever known. And the last thing you need to know is this: Mars has my heart.


I don‚Äôt know if Mars know how I feel, and I‚Äôm not gonna tell him just yet, but I am currently in the process of getting him to tutor me so that we can spend more time together. I‚Äôll keep y‚Äôall posted with any updates. 

Love,

"First, let me say that I am not the artistic type. My fiance on the other hand is extremely well-skilled at crafting and decorating. We've been dating for almost 5 years and, if it wasn't for her, my house (and life) would be empty. 

Over the years, she has given me some amazing, custom gifts. Greeting cards, love coupons, even a personalized Jeopardy game based on our experiences together. She's really a pro at DIY crafts and decorations.

We've also accumulated ticket stubs, hiking brochures, hotel keys from our vacations, and so much more through the years. I love to look through it all sometimes and reminisce on our time together. I have a lot of it displayed in my home office, but not nearly all of it. Many items sit in a cabinet and go untouched, collecting dust throughout the years, and it kills me.

I've tried to think of ways to display everything, or at the very least do something with it all. For example, I did my own DIY Memory Jar and gave it to her on her birthday, hoping she could use it to keep track of everything we do in a year. I also purchased a 60"" x 40"" corkboard off Amazon to display all the greeting cards, but ran out of space a year ago.

What ideas could you give me to help memorialize these items? I've thought about doing shadow boxes but again, not too skilled in the art department. 

This is the only subreddit I came across where I was comfortable posting about this. Are there any others out there I can reach out to that might be able to help me?

Thank you for your input!",romance

"I‚Äôm not an expert but I know from school that many years back women were considered men‚Äôs property. With The right connects or money a man could usually take any women he wanted for the right amount and make him his bride. I‚Äôm talking about like the castle ages and earlier 

To me it seems like more of a business transaction and didn‚Äôt require any use of the heart. If a father found a better suitor it was just business and everybody moved on.

I often wonder what percent of people legitimately gotten into actual romances. Obviously there are these fictional plays (Romeo and Juliet as an example) where lovers relationship was based off pure love and not money  so the ideas wasn‚Äôt totally far fetched. ",romance
"**Some Background...**

*I'm a 20-year-old dude who likes, Captain Beefheart,  David Bowie, King Crimson and other types of weird music and shit. I had a semi short-lived and very emotionally draining, painful relationship in my junior year of high school. After High-school, going into my first year of college, I was starting to try dating again, but every way the wind blew I flew the opposite direction. When I had an actual chance with someone who was beautiful, lovely, and all-around great... I was ghosted. Ever since then my romantic language (flirting, hitting-on, banter, and etcetera) has gone from my psyche and all I can say is oh cool, or nod and what-not. I feel so alienated and depressed from the people around me in my own college classes, some of the professors, and all the political/medical issues going on in the world, and the only people I find comfort in are my old friends in high school.*

"The cold and dimly-lit jail cell was completely silent. At the same time, every inch of it emanated a depressing chill.

There was a clatter as someone pushed the door open, letting a lone ray of light into the shadowy cell.

Gu Qingmang raised her hand to cover her eyes. The sudden light was blinding. 

""Criminal No. 46, Gu Qingmang. We're carrying out your death sentence."" The prison guard held a thin notebook as he announced the fate that was soon to befall her.

Qingmang's black hair draped across her shoulders. She stood up like a zombie, accepted the cuffs around her wrists, and followed the guard out of the cell door.

The corridor leading to the outside world was lit with the occasional rays of light, but to her, the path led to nowhere but hell.

This was the road she had chosen, and she walked it willingly. 

At the end of the corridor, she saw the figure that had never once left her dreams. However, the one holding on to his arm was no longer her. Someone else had taken her place.

It was her stepsister, He Yuan. The fated enemy she could never escape.

Their eyes met. Their gazes said a thousand words, told a hundred stories.

In the end, however, the man looked away. The corners of Qingmang's lips curved with the ghost of a tragic smile.

""Qingmang."" He Yuan, who had been holding the man‚Äôs arm whilst standing by his side, spoke first. Letting go of the man's hand, she walked toward Qingmang.

He Yuan could not wipe the smile off her face, her eyes shining brightly with happiness. ""Qingmang, I heard that today's the day of your execution, so Brother Xiyuan and I came all this way to see you off. Thank you for everything you did for us. Don't worry, I won't forget you, so go in peace.""

Gu Qingmang scoffed. ""What are you thanking me for? For taking the fall for you? Or for giving up my spot so you two can be together? What if I don't go in peace? Shall I turn into a vengeful ghost and haunt you every day?""

He Yuan flinched for a split second, but her usual smile quickly returned. Walking up to Gu Qingmang, she straightened her stepsister's hair and clothes before moving in even closer. Then, she rubbed her belly gently and said, ""Gu Qingmang, we got married. Also, I'm three months pregnant.

""Oh, and I don't think you know this yet, but the entire Gu Family Group belongs to me now. I'm the true heiress to the Gu Family. As for you, you'll soon pass on and be relegated to the pages of history!""

Gu Qingmang's pupils dilated as her eyes turned bloodshot. Underneath her loose prison uniform, her fingertips dug fiercely into her palms.

Married? Three months?

She had only taken He Yuan's place in prison a month ago, but she was already three months pregnant. Did that mean that all of her maternal grandfather's lifework had fallen into He Yuan's hands?

So, what had Gu Qingmang been all this time? A fool who had played right into their hands?

""Zhao Xiyuan! You promised!"" Gu Qingmang growled through clenched teeth, raising her gaze to the man who had not said a word since his appearance.

When the man avoided her gaze, her heart felt piercingly cold. This was the man she had loved so madly in the past. 

He had promised that he would only ever love her. He had promised that if she took the fall for him, he would find the best lawyer to defend her. He had promised that even if she died, he would forever stay by her grave. He had promised that he would take good care of the Gu Family Group and bring it to unprecedented heights. He had made her so many promises, but all of them were empty‚Ä¶

Gu Qingmang abruptly burst into laughter. However, her eyes were filled with endless despair. 

He Yuan's eyes widened with a hint of confusion as she looked at Gu Qingmang. Even the man standing a short distance away was shocked.

""Zhao Xiyuan, I was blind to fall for you in this lifetime. If there is such a thing as the next life, I will never fall for you again!

‚ÄúIf there's such a thing as the next life, I'll make you pay for everything you did to me, bit by bit!‚Äù

Before her execution, Gu Qingmang closed her eyes. Her life over the past twenty-odd years flashed through her mind. 

It was a life full of such spectacularly mistaken devotion!

As the drugs took effect, numbing her mind, she vaguely seemed to hear Lu Yanmu's voice calling out her name‚Ä¶

However, Lu Yanmu had left her a long time ago, had he not?

The scene from that day replayed in her mind again‚Ä¶

""Qingmang, I'll let you go. From now on, you and I have absolutely nothing to do with each other.""

That man's words were full of determination and despair as it seeped out of his thin lips. His eyes gleamed with an emotion she could not read, even though she could detect the hints of despair.

As the cold wind blew, his body seemed to become weaker, drowning in his loose clothing and threatening to fall apart.

He used to be so fit and strong. Gu Qingmang looked at what was left of his disease-ravaged body and felt a sudden ache in her heart.

Lu Yanmu once had everything going for him, but his love for her was an all-consuming madness. One might even call it a plague.

He had an infinite pool of patience for her, fulfilling her every desire, no matter how ridiculous the request. All this so he could make her happy.

She had hurt Lu Yanmu cruelly, and now she was the one having her heart broken by another. Could this be karma?

She had pushed Lu Yanmu aside, diving headfirst into the abyss without looking back. As a result, she had been betrayed by everyone around her, and now she was dying alone in prison. 

Lu Yanmu, if there is such a thing as the next life, I won't ever let you down!",romance

"I've recently found the band Hyber. [Look them up on all the places you find music] There is a song 'You Were' that strikes me like a love story with some identity issue keeping the singer from accepting their deep love. Then there is the song 'Funny' that seems to speak to post breakup strength. The song 'Good for me' speaks to a relationship from the unrequited. 

I was a deep romantic when younger and through many years of immaturity, selfishness and self destruction I became damaged and unfamiliar with the power and desire of deep romantic love. 

Listening to this band Hyber has helped to bring some romantic feels and even powerfully positive hope back.

"Okay, let's talk about our first kiss experience. This is mine :

My girlfriend came visiting. I had prepared dinner for us. The moment was fun filled, we laughed, played fun games, joked about stuffs, smiled at each other, eat then relaxed. The time came for her to leave, it was dark as there was a power failure in the area, so we made use of the torch on my phone, which was not very bright. 

The door entrance is higher than the floor of my room, I was on the entrance while waiting for her to fix up herself. While waiting she gave me a gum to chew, which I resisted, but she persisted. I didn't know what she was up to, sometimes I now feel that I was so dumb with respect to romantic seduction skills. So I took the gum and did chew it. 

She then approached the door and told me about the oil drop (from the food) on her top. I pointed the torch at the distance I was and couldn't find anything of such. She told me to draw closer. Note, she was still in the room, while I was at the door post, that means I was now ""taller"" than her, tho we were really of the same height.

Closer I went but still couldn't see anything. That's when she said I should bend, pointing to her breast region. In curiosity I bent and what I experienced happened at the speed of light:

	  while I  opened my mouth again to say "" I can't find anything...""  I felt her hand on the back of my neck, a pull towards her body , I felt a soft, slender object (that is her tongue) inside my mouth with a movement that created an irresistible sensation all thru my body and a soft lips on my mouth, I couldn't resist it, so I gave in.

Thereafter, she breathed a sigh of relief. ""That was amazing"" I replied, then went ahead to ask for more. Well, at the moment we're no more together. 

So now over to you. Let's hear yours. ",romance
"Hello. I have a little problem at that moment that‚Äôs kind of eating away at me. I‚Äôm 13 and I know I‚Äôm extremely young to be thinking about romance or having love in my life. But there was a situation that happened a couple months that made me feel really happy. The happiness I‚Äôve ever felt, and I thought that was strange but didn‚Äôt think too much of it. I was happy. 

So on this app called ‚ÄúAmino‚Äù there are tons of communities. One in particular had my favorite anime/manga so I joined it (in July of 2018). Fast forward to a couple months later (in January of 2019). I met this boy online that claimed he was 15. We started talking and became friends. We had a lot in common when it came to music and life. One day we played a game of +18 truth or dare with a couple of his friends. I dared him to kiss the person he likes online (a different girl), but suddenly he kissed me (online). I was confused, but happy. And I did the same. One thing lead to other and we were in a relationship. It lasted for about a couple weeks until....my dad heard me talking on phone with some of my friends from the app on a voice chat. He got mad and I was banned from ever going back on there again. But before that my mom did attempt to work through this with me but I was too stubborn and very rude. That was when my whole world just crashed. She said I‚Äôm never allowed to go back on there and I got my phone taken away from me for a month. I cried and told myself things will okay and if they see good in it then they would let me go back on there. But my hopes were crushed. Those unrealistic thoughts. A childish fantasy that was real and would never happen. 

I wanted to say goodbye to him. Talk to him one last time. I know it‚Äôs stupid and extremely immature but I don‚Äôt know. I cared about him. I just wished it stayed a bit more longer. 

I know there are dangers to the internet, but still, even after 2 months also 3, it hurts like hell. I just feel empty. 

But I know he‚Äôll forget about me and move on to the next girl...

If you made this far, congratulations :)",romance
"  

She woke up and saw her brother sleeping on his writing table in the room. They were not rich enough to have a large house with many rooms, they only could afford this small flat with one room and squeezed everything the needed in it. He usually slept on the table while writing when could not fight with the sleep any longer. Last night he worked for longer hours and gave in to sleep, she could not tell when because she never woke as late as he. She approached him, kissed his head and took a page he fell sleep writing last night, he had no work and contributed to income only through writing short stories online, sometimes they got long and he had to finish them on another day. The page was not completely filled so she thought maybe she can peak into the ending of the story and began to read because there was still time for her to be ready and go to work.

""How can love for something drive you crazy day by day slowly, slowly. When you really want something but it is just out of your range. Like a good video game for a kid who passes by the video store every day and desire it, looks at it, but just can't buy it. If that happens to you long enough you will eventually give into madness. It is same with me dear sister. I know that you have brought me up and have been taking care of me ever since our parents and are like a mother to me. You worked two jobs only to feed me when I was little and unable to earn any money, hell I still am, and these writings are not very well accepted because somehow my own self creeps into them, my passion is expressed and society does not like it. But what can I do, I can't keep it in.""

With a thundering heart she turned the page.

""Seeing you going coming out of bathroom with your wet hair and then swaying it in the room where I could see every single day. I have to say something to someone, anyone, since I couldn't say it to you I started writing hence most of my stories base on the subject. I am sorry for hiding it, but I feared that you would hate me for what and how I feel about you. But this feeling is just uncontrollable and I can't hold it any longer but before I do anything that would discern your disapproval, I am going to go away from you. I am going to leave you, because I can't stop loving you.

Her heart was thundering her hands were trembling, her body was shaking her head was aching. Tears dripped from her eyes as she realized that her brother was deeply in love with her but she could not respond in kind. She had to maintain herself and him as well, otherwise the society would not let them live. They will be driven away and hunted down. As many before them were hung, burnt alive, thrown in pits and executed in most horrible ways thinkable. They will forever be named demons and children as abomination their legacy a curse, they will not find a place to hid and there will be no escape from their plight. She shook her brother up to wake him up but he did not move and his head slipped from table. Horrified she looked at him for a second and began to sob. She dare not touch him and only hoped that it was not true, she only hopped that he was alive. She wanted to call his name out loud but she had lost her voice, frozen in her step her body was paralyzed. When she broke off it she leapt on him checked his pulse, tried to find it, failed and let out a howl. Her body began to convulse rapidly and fell on him, face close to his. She closed her eyes, put her arm on his head and kissed him on lips.",romance

"This is a long story, feel free to go to the line that starts ‚ÄúLast night‚Ä¶‚Äù If you‚Äôd prefer to expedite the story. I‚Äôd so appreciate any advice from this! 

So I have a dilemma. I‚Äôm 80% sure that my ex is contacting me with fake numbers and snapchats. We were together in college from 2015 - 2019. We ended up breaking up because we were in a long distance relationship. He joined the Navy in 2018 and we tried our best to stay together thru it all. We both had trust issues and admitted to cheating here and there, but we were still in love with each other. By summer of 2019 I felt conflicted with marrying him. He was going to be based in another state and wanted me to marry him ASAP. At first I was with the idea, but then I though it would be too soon for us. I wasn‚Äôt used to the idea of eloping, and I felt our parents would not approve. From that day he asked me to marry him, I told him I loved him but I couldn‚Äôt stay with him at that time. I felt insecure with the idea that I still needed to get my life together (career, finances, etc.) and I didn‚Äôt want to jump into something i wasn‚Äôt completely sure about. We didn‚Äôt ‚Äúofficially‚Äù break up, but we stopped talking for a month until I reached out to him on his birthday. 

A few weeks later (end of July) my friend sends me a post on facebook with him, a girl (in uniform) and a baby, caption reading: ‚ÄúWifey and our bouncing baby girl‚Äù. I was shocked that he was already in a relationship claiming someone as his wife and he has a baby?! I immediately call him and he says the baby wasn‚Äôt his but his new girlfriend‚Äôs niece, that the caption was a joke. From that coco we quarreled a bit and didn‚Äôt speak afterwards. We went our separate ways. 

October comes along and I get a call from my ex and he‚Äôs saying the my friend texted him to call me, saying that I needed help. Apparently this friend informed my ex that I was evicted and going through hard times. Which was weird, because I‚Äôm a super reclusive person and there‚Äôs no one I gave that information to at all. I tried calling that friend that texted my ex and they never picked up or returned my texts. I was so furious that they were that invasive to tell my ex to call me about being evicted. 

December comes and I get a random text from an unknown number reading: ‚Äú\[MY NAME\]?‚Äù. I try to call and there‚Äôs no answer. By this time I hear my ex and his new gf are officially married. 

March comes and I get a text from a St. Louis number. (where my ex is from) reading: ‚ÄúAyo‚Äù. I ignore it. The next day I get another text from a Columbia, MO # in the evening reading ‚Äúfam‚Äù. I respond believing it must be the same person from the day before that I didn‚Äôt respond to. 

Throughout our correspondence this person is telling me to meet up at local club in KC. They tried calling me I don‚Äôt answer. I call them and they don‚Äôt answer. I ask them for their name and they beat around the bush, and say ‚ÄúNd I c I got a Chance now I c ya boy on social media got married‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm surprised that this random person is texting me about my ex and wants to meet up. I ask them for more details so we can meet up but the club this person claimed they were at was closed. So why did they say they were there? 

They later add me on snapchat with their name being Brian Allen. I‚Äôve never heard of this person in my life or seen them EVER, once they started uploading images on snapchat. None of the images were originally taken from snapchat, they were uploaded from camera roll. 

Through our convo on snapchat though he asks several times ‚Äúis the door still open with your ex?‚Äù I ask why it matters if he‚Äôs married now. ‚ÄúBrian‚Äù responds saying he wants to know because he‚Äôs interested in dating me. 

If any man is interested in me, at least in my experience, they‚Äôre not mentioning my past/ex, especially if they‚Äôre married now. I didn‚Äôt understand this stranger‚Äôs concern. 

Brian says that Missouri guys don‚Äôt care about marriage, that an open door between ex‚Äôs isn‚Äôt strange at all. We corresponded shortly after until he abruptly deleted his snapchat. 

Last night I get a text at 1:30am. Sending me a pic of my ex‚Äôs Facebook, saying ‚ÄúWTF he‚Äôs married now? I loved you 2 together, call me.‚Äù AGAIN i don‚Äôt know this number. I call them around 2am. No answer. I wake up again around 10 and ask who they are. 

I then text my ex‚Äôs direct line to see if they can still receive texts from me. They ask me if I‚Äôm working today, and I say no. They continue to tell me how my ex missed out on a good lady (myself), but then also say, that new girl he‚Äôs with has him in good shape. I‚Äôm like o..k? U just texted me saying you loved us together now you‚Äôre mentioning how great his new marriage is? 

I tell this person that I‚Äôm changing my number because of all the incidents leading up to today, that I‚Äôm inconsolable because of all the bs that I‚Äôm dealing with randomly almost every other month. I try to reel them in. They ask why I‚Äôm inconsolable. And I say ‚ÄúI want to talk to my ex before I change my number but he‚Äôll never want to talk to me‚Äù. They ask me what I need to tell him and then give me his number. This number still does not release their name, but claims they‚Äôre my friend and cals me again later in the afternoon. I stopped responding after my last text. 

Now I‚Äôm conflicted. I do still have feelings for him. But also I feel so much damage has been done and I don‚Äôt ant to pursue this messy situation. How can I prove this is my ex? Should I call my ex and ask if he knows these people, or express my experience the past few months with him? Is it wrong to still want to be with him? What should I do?

I‚Äôll go about perfectly fine for a while and then randomly I get these texts from these people I DONT KNOW and it‚Äôs so frustrating. Someone is stalking me‚Ä¶..",romance

Chapter 1 Child

Inside the best gynecology and obstetrics department of the most prestigious hospital in Jin City...

Jiang Sese gritted her teeth as she endured the acute labor pain in her abdomen. Breaking out in a cold sweat all over, she clutched the guardrails on both sides of the bed so tightly that her knuckles were turning white.

Seeing this, the obstetrician gently comforted her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared. The child will be born safe and sound. Everything will soon pass.‚Äù

Jiang Sese nodded, the rims of her eyes tinged red. She was full of reluctance.

Her child would be taken away right after she gave birth.

For nine months, she had watched the little creature grow little by little in her womb. Despite trying her best not to form an emotional connection with the baby, her heart nonetheless still ached at this moment.

She was sorry, so sorry...

Her eyes reddened.

It wasn‚Äôt that she didn‚Äôt want this child, but rather, she couldn‚Äôt have it.

After giving birth and taking the money, she would no longer have anything to do with her baby.

Pain shot up to her brain again and her vision darkened. Waves of regret swept over her.

She didn‚Äôt want the money anymore, just the child. Just the child...

No one could hear her silent cry for help. After the obstetrician gave her a shot of anesthetic, she gradually lost consciousness until complete darkness enveloped her. Then, she lost all sense of perception...

An hour later, Jiang Sese woke up inside a hospital ward.

She was all alone. The entire ward was empty, save for the check on the bedhead. The check was for one million yuan, not one cent more or less!

Jiang Sese felt like someone had carved a huge chunk out of her heart.

She subconsciously reached for her flattened stomach. Tears began streaming down her face...

In the future, there would no longer be a mischievous creature moving about in her womb.

She didn‚Äôt even get to take a look at her baby!

Thinking about she would never see her child again, she cried even harder.

Before she could audibly sob, someone pushed the ward door open.

Jiang Sese looked at the door and saw an arrogant Jiang Nuannuan taking large strides into the ward in her high heels.

For a moment, she didn‚Äôt know what to do. She subconsciously tried to sit up, as difficult as it was, but a piercing pain soon came from her abdomen.

Anyone who was just wounded during the labor process would be incapable of such a rough motion. She tumbled back onto the bed, her face a frightening shade of white.

Jiang Nuannuan towered over the bed, sizing her up with a disdainful look. ‚ÄúI knew it was you, Jiang Sese!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù

Jiang Sese was just as furious as she was startled. Her eyes were filled with indescribable hatred and resentment.

Jiang Nuannuan paid her no mind as if she were used to such a response. She had the smile of a victor. ‚ÄúSichen and I are getting engaged soon. I‚Äôm here for a premarital check-up‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see you here. Jiang Sese, oh, Jiang Sese. How the mighty have fallen! For the sake of money, you have no qualms about selling out your body and giving birth to another man‚Äôs child.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù

Enraged, Jiang Sese grabbed whatever there was on her bedside table and started flinging them at Jiang Nuannuan.

She exhausted every last sliver of energy in her as if she despised this woman.

Her movements aggravated her wound and hurt her so much that she almost blacked out.

Jiang Nuannuan easily evaded her attack, her smile turning even smugger. ‚ÄúYou must be furious because I‚Äôm right on the mark. What if I told you that one year ago, I was the one who removed your mother‚Äôs oxygen mask? What if I told you that I was the one who took the money that Dad prepared for her medical fees? I‚Äôd even tell you that I was the one who told Brother Sichen about you giving birth. Wouldn‚Äôt that infuriate you to death?‚Äù

Jiang Sese was in utter disbelief after hearing all of that.

She was already hurt after losing her child. Now that she had learned the truth, she felt such mental torment that she was about to go mad. Even her emotions were going haywire, so much so that she was becoming hysterical.

‚ÄúWhy, Jiang Nuannuan? I have never wronged you! Why must you do this to me? You wicked woman‚Ä¶ You won‚Äôt be at peace even if you die! Never at peace!‚Äù

Jiang Nuanuan was very pleased by her reaction. Her expression, however, turned solemn. ‚ÄúWhy, you ask? To ruin you, of course! You haven‚Äôt wronged me, that much is true. But your existence is an obstacle to me‚Ä¶‚Äù

She continued, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre both daughters of the Jiang family, but why are you the princess and I‚Äôm the illegitimate daughter? Everything that happened‚Äîevery incident, every remark‚Äîis a debt that I‚Äôll claim from you. I have won it at all now‚Ä¶ Be it Dad, the Jiang family fortune, even Brother Sichen... They‚Äôre all mine now. And you‚Äôre just a child abandoned by our family! Hahaha!‚Äù

Jiang Sese could hear Jiang Nuanuan‚Äôs self-satisfied laughter ringing in her ears. Every sound was like a dagger that ripped open her bloody scars.

Jiang Sese recalled what had happened a year ago...

Her mother had been fine lying on the hospital bed, but her condition abruptly took a turn for the worse. She had gone to her father, wanting some money to save her mother, yet she couldn‚Äôt even get a single cent from him.

It was also then that she learned that her childhood friend and fiance, Lan Sichen, was having an affair with Jiang Nuannuan.

Her heart went cold then. Desperate to save her mother, she was forced to go down this path.

Little did she imagine that everything was part of Jiang Nuannuan‚Äôs scheme.

After that day, she was thrown out of the Jiang residence.

Jiang Sese could clearly remember how indifferent her father looked when he told her: ‚ÄúAfter you leave, don‚Äôt ever mention that you‚Äôre from the Jiang family, lest you make a fool of yourself.‚Äù

Her fiance was even crueler, criticizing her with a disdainful look on his face. ‚ÄúJiang Sese, how can you do something so disgusting?‚Äù

These memories stirred an already weak Jiang Sese.

Her lips turned pale. The interweaving pain and resentment made her feel like she was submerged under waves of water. Until‚Ä¶ she sank into the boundless darkness.",romance
"Chapter 1 - Child

Inside the best gynecology and obstetrics department of the most prestigious hospital in Jin City...

Jiang Sese gritted her teeth as she endured the acute labor pain in her abdomen. Breaking out in a cold sweat all over, she clutched the guardrails on both sides of the bed so tightly that her knuckles were turning white.

Seeing this, the obstetrician gently comforted her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared. The child will be born safe and sound. Everything will soon pass.‚Äù

Jiang Sese nodded, the rims of her eyes tinged red. She was full of reluctance.

Her child would be taken away right after she gave birth.

"Alright ladies and gents of r/romance, I desperately need your help. So recently I met this girl. For the longest time, I'd given up on dating or romance as I'd lived a pretty crazy and some would even say fiction-like life on this earth. With all my experiences my head had taken to being stuck up in the clouds, whether as an escape or just due to loneliness and keeping myself company idk. So when our friends introduced us I just kind of figured she would be another friend and nothing more. However over the course of a couple of weeks as we got to talking I realized that she is literally the only person I've ever met who's had similar life experiences to me. As such a thing goes, we've been getting close. We're sort of an item now, but there's a problem. One of those experiences we have in common is a large number of parental issues. I don't mean this  as an edgy teenage 'I hate you mom and dad' way, but she lost her mother when she was young, and I my father, My mom is always busy now, working full time as a teacher and running a part-time tutoring business so I rarely ever see her and basically raised myself since I was 11. Her dad works a lot too but married another. Her stepmom is a little odd though. She restricts her from any communication via phone to any other people besides her and a handful of 2-3 girls that they've known for a long time. The reason, as far as I can tell, is being a helicopter parent but I'm not here to judge. The problem is we go to different high schools so they only times we get to talk is at football games and the occasional youth group party. So my question, what pieces of tech can I buy that would allow for basic texting, like a pager, but with a larger screen and two way sending? The best way I can think to describe it is like a pair of walkie talkies but for texting. Does anyone know of anything like this?",romance

"What is your philosophy in life? What is life? What is life to you? How do we know good from bad? 

Is it really bad for someone to steal something? Is it really bad to lie? if so how? Because society said so? Who is the society to shape how we are? Because God said so? How can I believe God if there is no solid evidence of God existing? Will we be punished for those so called ""Bad"" things that we do? If so how? If it's bound to happen it's bound to happen, isn't it? I know sometimes i feel that something bad happens to me because I've done something bad before, that could possibly cause this other bad thing to happen to me, even though they have nothing to do with each other, is it because of Karma? Is Karma even real?  Because even when i do good i don't get any good, I still get the same shit, what's the point of doing any good if you don't get anything back? I know that sounds selfish but I've had enough of being selfless.

"This all began in 2016 when in my class I saw a pretty girl to whom I never looked upon as a love interest but slowly as time passed I started loving her. I would do anything that would make her happy but the problem was she always saw a friend in me. This was all smooth throughout 2016 but then in 2017 when we actually started coming closer, things were changing. We started talking to each other for hours and hours on mobile. Would gossip. Would study for like 2-3 hours and then call each other. I thought that this would work out but I was always scared. One day I even told her about how I felt but her reaction wasn't so good so I told her that it was my friend. I didn't want to lose someone this precious just because of a ""relationship"". Days passed. On my birthday she gifted me a luxury chocolate (I have the wrapper of the chocolate till date). It was all good. I promised her on my birthday that I'll make her birthday even more special. It was her birthday on which I made a birthday card which was 'romantic' and gave her a luxury chocolate. I did something else too which isn't that necessary. Well what happened next was she started changing. She started hating her life, she started hating everything to which she concluded that she was depressed. Well nothing special. I cheered her up and made her happy but the bond was getting worse. It was an important exam for which we were gonna appear so we stopped talking to each other. The exams were over and during the farewell party we met the last time. It had a game in which the person has to write their views about the person on a paper. Well I approached her and wrote some special things. It was like long ass and I was the only one who wrote something this big. She wrote for me and yes, it included 'I love you'. Well this doesn't end here. What I learnt was the person I loved the most never loved me. When I was with her in her pain, she dating a dumbass and she even kissed her. This really got on my nerves as for me I never ever touched her except on her birthday to wish her. She used to show the signs that she liked me by like sometimes touching my hands, poking my arm and all that. Well currently I have dumped her and I'm an incel now. I don't have a life.  Basically I got friendzoned too hard. I relate my situation totally to 13 Reasons Why. Me being Clay and she being but the only difference is that she didn't suicide nor she was raped. This isn't much detailed but it includes most of the events in my life.

I even tried to lower my standards when it came to communication to make it better on him. It‚Äôs just like he gets worst every year. Not only is his communication trash, his romance is trash.

"So I am 23, turning 24 in a month, and in the middle of my last semester of college. I have never had any meaningful romantic experiences in my life, not even a kiss, and needless to say the single tag and virgin tag sit particularly heavy on me. The only thing close to a silver lining in this whole lack of experience with females is that it has given me plenty of time to sort things out and identify some key problems all the letting them get deeper seeded. 

I am confident in my looks (I'd say a 6-7 easy(not to sound like a pompous fool)) and stand 6'2. Personality wise I am often quite good at making others laugh and seem to be the type people will confide in. However, I come from a particularly hairy family and sit uncomfortably under average in penis size at around the size of a toilet paper tube. The underwhelming nature of my member is a fact about myself that left me in a deeply depressed state for a while until realizing it's not the end all be all, though, it still haunts me and greatly robs me of any and all self-esteem.

It is needless to say I consume a lot of romance based media and porn with the singular constant being that smol peened men are nothing but jokes. One of my greatest fears in finding a woman I was interested in is that I would not be able to properly satisfy her the way another man could due to my condition. The only thing apparently worse than being ill equipped is inexperience as it seems you are expected to come in hitting home runs.

As a result of the aforementioned physical insecurities as well as the rapidly decreasing regard for men in society I have acquired a number of quirks. At any given chance I will go out of my way to not even look at women out of the fear it will be taken the wrong way. I immediately assume the worse when women approach me despite logically knowing it couldnt possibly be so bad and will tense up as if I was staring down a bear. The few women I do regularly communicate with I realize I am only able to do so because they are either attached to other men or I simply view them as one of the guys.

The older I get with no experience at all with women has lead to the formation of complexes that can force me into what I could only describe as panic attacks. Ever since I was a teen I justified my own patheticness by saying that I would never  afflict myself on a woman as that would rob her of finding a better man. I might jokingly claim I am okay with becoming a wizard at 30 do to my virginity, but the reality couldnt be further from that. 

From what I can tell my window of opportunity is closing rapidly as no sane woman, from what I understand, could ever possibly want a shrimp-dicked terrified virgin as a mate the stigmas of which I feel get worse by the day.

I am okay with sharing any other information within reason, i am just looking for any advice to break the terrible mental walls i have formed and to possibly gain some light at the end of the tunnel if possible..

Also sorry if this doesnt fit under romance, i am new to reddit and will promptly delete it if i messed up",romance

(I will be telling the other story literally right after this so it will make sense) So this guy I like, let's call him Owen, Well my best friend just left with my cousin aka her boyfriend, so It was My three friends and Mike. We met up with my one friend who was with his cousin and Mike went to go after one of the guys, Well he beat his ass and Mike was on the floor crying and yelling at the guy who beat him up. He obviously didn't learn his lesson because he went to go slap my ass again until owen who was right beside me saw and turned around and said ""don't"" And Mike backed off immediately, I was shaken up a bit so Owen walked with me to his house and said if anything happens where Mike comes back just tell him. It's been a day and Mike left me alone.) SECOND STORY ABOUT OWEN ( So I met owen through a friend group, it's slap ass month so I met him by my friend slapping my ass and owen joining in, a day goes by an we get a bit closer so maybe four days later when the fight goes on and all and Owen protected then I said see ya later and he said ""maybe"" So I hoped to see him, I went outside and waited hoping to see him, but I didn't so I was sad. I walked by the playground and Owen came running up to me, he was almost in a fight, and we walked alone until this girl who spread rumors about me a few years back came over to us holding a kitten, so he was being all cute with the kitten and took it home and told us to wait outside and we did, so he came back out and walked her home then me home, but he didn't leave we had an argument about what lockers are used for and then I don't know what happened, he started choking me, he wouldn't hurt me so he then would put his face close to mine and then licked my nose, he did it a lot, but then pulled me into a back hug and kissed my forehead, then I scooted closer to him and he said don't get closer, I thought he was gonna tickle me because he always tickles me, but instead he kissed me and I was freaking blushing out of my mind. He would always pull me into a hug or choke me and we would laugh, and then he helped me up onto the railing and called me short as he is 5'8 and freaking gave me a look this went on for an hour until he had to go, does this mean there is like one chance he likes me",romance

After that it started to develop more into something obvious. Our car started to have issues so I asked around who knows how to work on cars and they said that he does. So even though he was sick, his sister told me that he would be on his way to take a look at the car. He came and when I opened the door, his face was all red and like an awkward ""hi"" lol.
The next day we saw each other at church and he kept asking if I still needed someone to look at the car and I said don't worry about it if your sick, my dad could find someone, but he would just insist.

I was leaving through the door, and I didn't notice he was holding the door open, then he said bye (my name) and he just followed me to my car and tried to talk some more and still kept telling me to let him know if I need a car mechanic.
Days later, they all went out to eat as a group and once my mom and sister got there, he asked them out loud ""where is (my name)?"" and they replied to him ""oh she's sick at home she couldn't come"" 
My mom said herself she thinks he likes me, and she is always right about these things, also it's a known fact that moms always know lol.",romance

"So to start off I‚Äôll say this; I live in a tiny town in rural Alabama, the kind of place that people move out of to start there adult life.

I am starting to feel really left out, everyone around me is finding love and relationships and I‚Äôm just like wtf what do I do. 
It also doesn‚Äôt help that recently I accidentally fell hard for a coworker who then made it clear she just wanted to be friends, and has now stopped Snapping or texting me and barely talks to me at work. 

Now that I‚Äôm typing this out I realize i have kinda effed myself over a couple of times but still. Any advice or tips or anything would help put my mind at ease.

"So I met this girl about 2 weeks ago and we have been hanging out since. Probably 3 or 4 times already. I recently got out of an over 5 year long relationship and am very new to the dating scene. I feel awkward and bumbly. Yet when I'm with her It doesn't matter. We definitely dont click perfectly yet, but i think it's just cause we're so nervous. I know i am. We think very alike and have had really amazing meaningful conversations already. Personality wise shes a dime. 

The kicker is the kissing. I've heard stories online about how the first kiss says a lot about your compatibility and how there can be fireworks and all that. I always thought it was bullshit. I've loved my ex for years and never really had that. Kissing was always just okay. But with this girl. I just cant explain it. I was blown away entirely. I literally cannot process how amazing kissing her made me feel. I just go all smiles and am in heaven. I'll even think about it all the next day. I cant concentrate because shes all that's on my mind. I'm just really excited for what's to come",romance

"Here's the situation:

I've been talking to this guy for about two months on Whatsapp. Since we started talking, it was pretty clear that we were into each other and decided to have a conversation about our feelings. We agreed to explore it and see where it would take us. We have long conversations throughout the day. Some of our conversations consisted of our personalities, school, work, things we like and don't like, intellectual conversations, and sexual ones (quite a few times) etc. He says that he's really into me, and I reciprocate that same feeling. Here's the thing, we haven't met in person yet, and we plan to but given that I am a monogamous person, I would like to have a conversation about being exclusive the first time we meet or at least, about how uncomfortable it makes me feel when the person I'm talking to is talking to multiple people. To me, that's disrespectful, and I wouldn't want to waste my energy and time if he is considering other romantic or sexual partners. In other words, I would feel led on. Would you have this conversation the first time you meet in person, or wait a little? Why, or why not? Please take into consideration my situation. 

When we first started talking, I did not think about this as much until a particular conversation we had over whatsapp. This is how the conversation went:

I said, ""Don't you have work today?"" (Forgot it was a Saturday)

He said, ""No, lol. Are you sure you're in the right chat?""

I said, ""Yes, and lol, I thought you did.

He said, ""I don't work today. And lol, you're probably talking to another dude""

I said, ""Hmm, no, I'm only interested in you.""

He said, ""I like that, but I wouldn't want to limit you the freedom of getting to know other people you might be interested in."" 

To me, this doesn't mean that he might be talking to other people, but it implies the idea that he's okay with it and probably thinks it's okay to do that, when I'm not. Mind you, this conversation took place about two weeks ago. 

What are you thoughts on this? I would really appreciate a response.",romance

"There's a crush I've had (more of an obsession now) since January. When I say that he's the man of my dreams, he's absolutely perfect (read below what my definition of that ). He graduated this year and I'm got extremely upset at myself for not getting to know him better after the year ended.  I've been through an extreme amount of things in life and oddly enough, not trying harder to be friends with him is my biggest regret. I've never met someone like him. I don't really crush on people because they all feel the same to me nowadays (and can't keep their fucking eyes off their phones for a second). I did attempt to come out of my shell and become friends with him and we joked around in class and he was always very encouraging nice and always reminded me to speak up. I eventually got the courage to ask him to go for a walk and I ended up walking him back to his dorm about 20 minutes away. I found out a lot about him including his real first name (he gave me the name he prefers to be called be he doesn't like his own), where he's from, and I played along with all of his strange antics and jokes. I had meant to ask him for his number, but shied away from doing so.  About a week after that encounter, he stopped talking to me, moved seats and purposefully avoided me at all times. I had no clue what I had done wrong and I managed to stop and ask him once and he said that I began distracting him and I was a bit too fun during class. I said okay, thinking we were on good terms, but when went back to avoidance and all again. I even bought food in because I missed a party and he refused to eat any of it. I have no idea what in the world I could've done wrong. So we pretty much ended off on silent and bad terms. During the last month of the class, I began trying to find information on him, but I only had his first name to go off. About 4 weeks into my searching I ended up finding his full name, phone number (which I later found out was the house's landline), his address, his family members' names, who he lives with, his father's business, and his facebook profile that he doesn't really check. 3 weeks ago, I found out where he went at the end of his summer job last year and figured he would be there this year again (carnival)(found out today that he's working the same one). I would like to go to the duration of the carnival and wait out for him.  It's pretty much the only chance I have left at getting to know him. I was wondering if i should do it or not. Please let me know your opinion.

"I could write a 500 page book on this woman, but I'll spare you the pain and keep it simple.
(Also, I hate the name Patrick, that's what my mom was going to call me, so my friends started saying it because I hate it. These passages come from my own personal journal, and aren't edited because I'm lazy)

Faith is the most special, fragile, yet incredibly headstrong girl I have ever met. She is smarter than me, incredibly funny, and even stunning at times. She can be so adorable when wearing my jacket. For someone so fragile physically, she is the most untouchable person emotionally I have ever met. I admire (or enjoy) all of these characteristics. But beyond that, she's even better just to be around. She is so innocent yet not at the same time, you never know what you're gonna get with Fai. Like yesterday (11/28/17) after we had gotten home, I was showing Grant how light she was, and I was gonna pick her up, and she sees this and just wraps her legs around my waist as if that's perfectly normal. Then, when she's down, insists on a piggy back ride. Physical contact is her thing; I find it awkward, and she uses that to her advantage. If she's ever upset that she didn't get her way, she'll give it one last shot with a pouty face and a ""pwease Patwick?"" Before just forcing the physical contact. So basically she just lays on me till she gets her way. Lately she's added another last resort, the cold shoulder. In other terms, I'm ""whipped"" by my friend.
I guess this needs to be out there. Faith and I flirt. We don't intend to flirt, but we do. We also argue ""like an old married couple"". We overall, act a lot like a couple. We kinda cuddle, always touching when together, argue like an old married couple, flirt, and know each other well enough to make references that fly right over anyone else's heads. Sometimes I get the self awareness to see it too. Such as last night (11/28/17) when after the scholar's bowl meet Fai was telling MY embarrassing stories, while saying ""It's okay Patrick"" and running her fingers through my hair just the way I like. However, I chalk this up to our social awkwardness, rather than Fai liking me. I do see how we would look like a couple though. We do everything I've already said, we have what from the outside looks like pet names for each other, are each other's top bestfriends on snapchat, she pretty much has a reservation for my jacket, are always calling each other different forms of hoe, and are nigh inseparable at times. Even from the inside one can tell our relationship isn't normal. But honestly, that's why I love Faith and I's relationship so much; It's rather fitting. Neither of us are normal, so why should our relationship be? Just because it's an abnormal relationship doesn't mean it's a romantic one. People just don't understand that part. They find it so hard to understand that we aren't a couple, even though we act like one. ",romance

"
Love is something everyone wants and desires. It‚Äôs something that we all crave. We all wish to feel loved and to be in love with someone. Love can be described in different ways. There is the way you love your mom or dad. They brought you into this world and would go through anything to protect you. There is the love you feel for a sibling. You would protect them no matter what. Yes, they annoy you and yes you pick on them but you‚Äôll be damned if anyone else does. There‚Äôs the love you fee for the rest of your family. They‚Äôre your family and no matter how dysfunctional or crazy they will always be your family. Then there‚Äôs your friends. You love them like your siblings. You sometimes wish they were your siblings. Then there is the love I‚Äôm talking about. Whenever you are this person you smile and get instantly happy. They bring butterflies in your stomach and make you feel okay, even if it is momentarily. They can do no wrong in your eyes. They‚Äôre magnificent and beautiful. Love is a weird thing. Love makes you loose all your sense of time and other emotions. You‚Äôre trapped in one vision where everything is okay. Love is precious and beautiful. I love, love. You can love someone for their looks. You can love them for their personality, how they make you feel, how they treat you. You can love someone because they‚Äôre all of the above. However love can be dark. When you love someone who you knows will never love you it hurts, it eats away at you. You have false hope that maybe one day, but you know it‚Äôs not going to happen. You just wish you could be given a chance or be seen in a different light. You just wish you‚Äôd be returned with the love you feel. Love is weird and precious. Don‚Äôt let it slip away if you can help it. What should you do when the person you‚Äôre in love with likes someone who is in love with someone else? Keep your mouth shut and pretend things are fine. Keep smiling because they‚Äôre happy and beautiful. They‚Äôre happy and you are too because they are... you don‚Äôt want to ruin it. Be good to them because they‚Äôve been good to you. Keep it together. Don‚Äôt let then get sad again. You love them. ",romance

"It was the last lecture for this semester, after that the exams would follow up in a quick tempo. Jim was worried that he might not be able to learn all the necessary topics in time and had to postpone the exams once again.

He was not in a very good mood, he focused on one of the empty seats in the middle of the lecture room. ""Excuse me, may I go through?"" he asked one of the anonymous students. The student stood up and said ""of course"", a quick quite ""thank you"" hushed through Jim's lips as he passed by.

He sat down and put in his earphones to relax his mind and build up focus for the last lecture. Jim was a single 23 year old guy, struggling with his studies although this was one his favorite science fields. The mathematics behind the methods were just too difficult for him to comprehend, he wanted to know everything and knowing the little time they were given to prepare for exams it saddened him that he had to just focus on passing the exams instead of actually learning. At least that is what he thought and believed.

Right before the lecture started, a girl tapped on Jim's shoulders and asked ""Is this seat empty?"", Jim surprised by the fact that a girl was talking to him tried to keep his posture and said with a calm but stuttery voice ""yes, it is free."". She sat down next to him. Jim noticed her sweet parfume. ""That smell. It seems to be in nowadays"" he thought to himself. The lecture began and both went on carefully listening to the lecturer, hoping to catch even the slightest hints for the upcoming exam. They helped each other when they didn't hear or couldn't read something occasionally.

Jim felt almost sad that the lecture ended. He knew this wasn't considered as spending time with someone, but her sitting next to him somehow made Jim feel more comfortable yet also nervous at the same time, anxious for making a wrong move. Anyways, he never knew how to approach girls so just as always he thought about focusing on getting home as quickly as possible to study.

Jim's mind was convoluted with all sorts of different thoughts, just as usual. ""Talk to her"" said the one voice, the other countered ""No, you will harass and annoy her. Even if you talk, what are you going to talk about, huh?"". Jim was torn in between his thoughts.

Ann, the girl who sat next to Jim during this lecture had also mixed thoughts. ""Talk to him."" said one voice, the other voice countered as well ""No, what if he doesn't like you? Surely he is taken and don't want to hang around with you. Besides, you are not even wearing anything exciting or have make up on. He will find you ugly!""

Jim and Ann were both fighting with their inner-selves while waiting for the other students to get up and make room for them to leave.

Although the students took more time than usual to free up the way, it went too quick from Jim's point of view. As he reached the entrance and was about to go home he turned around one last time to see what Ann is up to. He saw her going her way but she was moving slowly. He sighed and went on his way. 

Ann was about go home too but she was still unsure to talk to Jim. She finally had the thought to ask him to study together. Unsure if she will have the confidence to actually ask him she sti turned around and but saw Jim leaving. She sighed and went home as well.",romance

I fell in love pretty quickly, as is my style. This time, it was different. It wasn‚Äôt purely out of desperation, or out of fear of being alone. I fell in love with the man I was with.

"I see Reddit as a home for philosophy, and I love to think about things, so that's cool. I always have questions about *everything,* just in my brain, it's ""Why this?"" and ""Why that?"" and Reddit seems like a cool place for me to express my cognitive world.  
I never let anything go unanswered, I search for an answer determined and usually never give up. Sometimes, I'm unlucky and I forget the question I asked XD

Sometimes, I question life, which, ultimately, is a question I cannot answer.

I know that when people are attracted to each other, they admire each other and then begin to subconsciously copy each other, the way they move, the way they talk, anything they can copy at all, without losing their own character.

So, I wonder, if when someone *loses* that attraction they may have for someone, will they keep those traits they have adopted during the time they were attracted? For a prediction, I think no, because even though when you go through a breakup you keep thinking about that person, you've moved away from them and you have nothing to copy. Also, you're going to be too sad for your subconscious mind to think about what to copy and you've lost the attraction, so you are not going to adopt new traits. But would the person keep the traits they adopted before? I think not.

This is what I think.

If possible, please answer my question in detail and if you can, find sources for an answer and tell me more about other effects when two people break up.",romance

We then comforted each other, and I proceeded to say: ‚ÄúCOVID-19....take me but not my loved ones.‚Äù He then proceeded to tell me: ‚ÄúI would prefer it if COViD-19 didn‚Äôt take you either.‚Äù I then proceded to say: ‚ÄúAwwww that is so so sweet!!! üòò And I hope COVID doesn‚Äôt take you either.

You know how they say there's someone for everyone? It's bullshit. An empty fucking platitude. 6 billion people. And there's no one for me. No one. No one for me. I justcwannamdie.,romance
"Okay so um...
I only see him as a platonic friend thing (trying to find out if I'm asexual and stuff rn, cuz I literally feel repelled by the idea of *stuff*)

But um...
We talk a lot, like a LOT, a girl that is also friends with him has told me that he might be interested in me, but umm... I'm a dumbos, is he giving me ""signs"" or am I like, okayish?




**So the things that he does that I think would be considered ""signs"" are:**

- He is always there for me e.g. I feel bad? He's there to give a hug 

- We talk about personal stuff a lot 

- We constantly tease eachother

- ""In case you ever feel down or sad text me okay? Or just text me if you feel like you want to chat or something, yeah""

- Me:* am happy *, him:""Pff"", me:""Whaat?"", him:""That's fucking cute"" (this happens a lot btw)

- So yeah, he calls me cute a lot and often goes ""awww""

- We've hugged so much at a high school trip thing that my shirt literally just smelled like him

- When our class was watching a movie I was trying to find a comfortable position to sleep in, I saw him just kind of shcoot closer to me and move on his chair, until he finally just looked at me and clapped his shoulder, so I slept on his shoulder ;-;

- Recently when I've hugged him, I felt his heart start to beat faster ;-;

- We literally just kinda layed in a dark room and talked for hours on a high school trip which was really chill and nice. I didn't look at him, but I felt his head turn on the pillow to look over at me a few times ;-;

- He leans in a lot when we're talking, a small thing but I can literally feel his like, body temperature thing right next to me ;_;

- Has said a lot of ""*usually* I don't like this, but not with you"" stuff (which sounds so cheesy that I might be lactose intolerant) ;_;

...

Am I an asshole?.. I just... Feel like I can't know for sure if he likes me, unless he tells me. But like... Am asshole for giving ""signs""? Putting my head on his shoulder instead of refusing is probably a ""sign""?..

Am confused 

What is *sign* and what is *friend*?

Am just wanna be friends or something 

Am having a squish but no more than friends 

Am leading him on?

Hjalp


**Update:**

Apparently we're dating now, wow. He has an asexual friend and told me that he recognized a lot of that in me and that's why he held off on making a ""move"". He is also confused himself btw, so we don't know where this is going yet, all we know is that we have *something* and that *something* feels nice",romance

"Im an eighth grader who is a first chair flutist. For the past few months until last Sunday (day of the concert), the band has been practicing a few songs that will be played in a concert. The concert will involve 3 other lutheran schools (not a competition), and we (including those other schools) will unite as one and play the exact pieces we‚Äôve been practicing. Two days before the concert, the other schools met at our school to rehearse and get used to how it will be like when we are united. The band teacher that conducted and taught us and the other schools assigned each student/individual to their seats. I looked around who i was sitting by. Because another school had another eighth grade first chair flutist, we had to share first chair (without actually using one chair obviously). That girl that i had to share first chair with was so STUNNING. Shoulder length blonde hair, soft-spoken, and quiet just like me. She even managed to start some nice conversations between us. On the day of the concert, of course everyone had to wear something nice or an aloha shirt. When i saw her again, her looks and my affection for her went from 9/10 to 20/10. This is because of her nerdy ray-ban glasses she actually uses on a daily basis, her dress, and her undone hair. This time we sparked even more conversations between us. She even started asking questions abt me and told me wut songs she sang when the choir was singing. Then, she talked abt her favorite parts of the music and which pieces were her favorite to rehearse and play, and judged how the flutist, that was accompanied with the piano for choir, was playing. I asked her if this was her last year. She replied, ‚Äúyea, this is my last year and then im off to high school. I wouldnt have to wear the same weird uniform my school requires anymore after.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúOh, ok.‚Äù I asked her wut school she applied to. She replied with ‚ÄúI didnt apply to any school because im not going to private school anymore! Yaaayy!!‚Äù She laughed very hard in a quiet manner and i was laughing too while face palming. I promised myself to play and practice a hard flute piece that i started practicing WAYYY BEFORE all of this happened. I even told myself to practice it during regular band classes, the rehearsal, and the concert without making sound. The girl saw me pull out the piece and place it on the music stand we were sharing (this was when the choir was singing and the band was taking a break/intermission. The choir was on risers that was placed in front of the entire band section and the audience really coyldnt see us at all). While i was quietly practicing, she had a surprised and impressed look on her face and was like ‚Äúmy gosh this is hard. Why and how is he playing this?!‚Äù This is a story of me having love at first sight to another blonde girl flutist from another school. ",romance
So basically ive loved this girl for the past two years and this Christmas eve ive chosen to ask her out and tell her how I feel is there anything I should say or how should I begin to tell her advice in the comments below,romance
"I'm a 17 year old male who is attracted to girls.

I used to feel normal romantic attraction. I practically always had a crush on someone. Back then, I was too shy to attempt anything or to admit my feeling to anyone. But when I was 15, I just oddly started feeling less attracted. Over the course of a few months, I lost nearly all of my sense of attraction. I just stopped liking girls, basically. Since then, I haven't really had a crush on anyone.

I don't know what triggered this. I've tried thinking about what was going on in my life back then, but I can't find anything definite.

Back in November, a friend asked me if I liked her. I said yes, and I was being truthful. I had on a few occasions felt something for her. Once, I felt strongly enough that I would describe it as being in love. I told her about my issues and she promised to wait for me to fix myself. I've been seeing a psychologist, but I've decided to see someone who specialises in relationships, as he wasn't really getting my problem. I also happen to have anxiety. I tried thinking about her, in the hope that I would gain more feelings. But it came to the point where thinking of her just became a source of stress, because I was afraid of not feeling anything. Unfortunately, she lost interest in me because I wasn't able to be affectionate enough with her, which I don't blame her for. She's moved on to someone else.

Currently, I'm feeling upset for the rejection but more determined to fix my problem.

As far as I can tell, my problem seems to be fairly rare. I've never heard about it affecting anyone else. Obviously, losing attraction to someone in particular isn't uncommon, but losing the ability to feel strongly about *anyone* is a problem.

I wanted to ask, has anyone here experienced this problem? And if you have rectified it, what helped?

I know that some people might consider this to not really be a problem, that I could live my life without ever having a relationship and be happy. But I do want a relationship, so this is a problem to me.

Thank you for reading my long post and for any help you can give.",romance

My husband and I have been married for 9 years...we are going through a rough patch and I'm missing the romance so much...

I just miss those feelings..,romance
"I met him 4 years ago. Met him at my workplace. I was a messed. Had family issues. He invited me over to his place. I lost my virginity to him. We slept 1 more time after that then we lost contact. I dont remember how we lost contact. I even forgot about him. 


Then, he found me. After 4 years. Claiming he ""lost but not forgotten"" me. He said he went back to my work looking for me but I left shortly after we stopped our connection. 

He invited me on a date. Try things out between us. Since we never really had a chance. I initially said yes but changed my mind as for me past is past. No need to bring it to my present.

Then he makes his argument about my way of thinking. I thought about it. Then, agreed to meet him. I won't deny that I was also horny that time. He knows about it that as much as possible I dont want to sleep with him yet but I will likely do. I cant keep my mouth shut. 

We slept together. He assured me it doesnt matter if I sleep with him first date or not. I can do whatever I want. Be real to him.

We saw each other couple more times. I always sleep at his place and he always cuddles with me. Then, I realized I'm starting to like him.

I talked to him about us. Well, I told him I was scared of him because he's good.. too good to be true. Then, we talked. 

Here is some of the excerpt of our convo:

He said he's not good but he was glad I feel that way towards him. Then,

Him: apparently im a fuccboi at least thats what women keep telling me

Me: Is that what you are or what people labelled you?

Him: i dont really do well with commitment i'll be honest. i have bad  history of that

Me: so you dont like commitment?

Him: Not really its too much weight at least rn but ur super chill thats why i havent freaked out i think but i dont want to hurt you at the same time 

blah blah then,

Him: I'm glad you feel that way. I like you too but I just dont want to break your heart if you develop feelings for me. I still want to habg out with you tho but I need to make sure you wont have expectations. Also I need a small break, like 2 weeks to deal with personal issue rn. If you are okay with that we can be good friends as long as emotionally you dont set up disappointment for yourself. You know what I mean?

Me: yeah no problem 

Then I asked him if he is still with his ex. Or anyone exclusively. He said no that they broke up but they talk from time to time.

I told him I would appreciate it if he tells me oncw they get back together or even sleep together since I dont want to cross that line AND we are sleeping with no protection. I know. Bad idea but we both clean tested and all. 

He responded with, ""we can be friends.i'll be honest then you can choose if you dont want to sleep with me"" 

He continued,

""i've had probs with her but she is still bit in my life  tbh but i dont want to lose you coz i havent figured it out yet so id like us to be friends if thats not awkward to you""

Me: So you still have feelings for her and still figuring things out with her but you like me as a friend

Him: I like you as a person



I decided to give him the space and time he is asking. I'm stupid I know. But, I'll take a risk even if I know my chances are not good. That he will ghost me. 100% chances he will definitely ghost me. 

At the end of the convo, he sent me heart emoji. I told him I will let him lead. Let him decide. I dont want to force myself to someone. If he ghosts me, then I move on. If he comes back in 2 weeks, decided that he will be with his ex then kudos to him. For the bravery. For keeping his word. If he comes back in 2 weeks and choose me, well. 


Am I stupid to give him that? Am I dumb? How dumb am I? Any comment is highly accepted üëåüèº",romance
"So basically, back when I was 12 years old I started Junior high, and there was this boy there. He was the popular class clown with that really good humor. One day I tell him""its annoying that everyone was trying to be like him but no one can do it."" I distinctly remember him telling me 

""You're the first one who's noticed that."" really softly and totally unlike himself. it all kind of developed from there. We started dating, and we stayed together for roughly 2 years, long and strong for a middle school relationship. We broke up and many of those wannabee boys started asking me out, all trying to be like him. Then comes graduation and we're all shipped off to college. It just so happens that the same guy went to the same place. 

The beginning of college was really tough on me romantically. I started to develop feelings again for him, and just as crushes seem to, he started popping up everywhere. The cafe where I studied, my physics class, etc. One night I'm in a particular wreck about him, when my someone began vigorously knocking on my door. Arming myself with a bat, I opened the door, and there he was, standing there, panting his tongue off. I'm just standing there, this total wreck and he says 

""I'm really annoyed that you were dating people who were wannabe me."" I'm just like ""What"" and he basically pours out his feelings and his reoccurrences in the places i went were a ploy to get near me again.

"[TLDR At the bottom]

So about 4 months ago I met a girl at my work (I‚Äôm a waiter 24m) and we hit it off really well and she kinda claimed me as her best friend. Now I had not been in a relationship in a very long time and everyone that had seen us together told me that she was totally into me. So of course I get excited and we hang out a few times and I ask her out, no biggie right? BIGGIE. She told me she didn‚Äôt really feel that way for me and that we should try to be friends. 

   So of course I was like yeah sure absolutely, but classic me I had already fallen for her super hard. But I was still happy to have her as a friend. 

   Fast forward 2 months and we are still pretty cool with each other we are hanging out a little less but now she is really seeming to be into me. Idk if she just is super flirty or what but I was convinced that she had a thing for me. So I kinda eased into asking if she liked me again. Bad idea. Now she‚Äôs sure. I spend about a week or two being heartbroken and still having to see her every day at work. 

   After those few weeks she stopped talking to me outside of work, stopped texting me, you know, the works. 

  Fast forward to now. She unfriended me on Snapchat, and I have texted her earlier this morning asking her if she wants to talk it out rather than just blocking each other on social media and having to work together every day in misery. She had not responded or viewed my text.

Idk what to do. I‚Äôm pretty sure I still have feelings for her and I‚Äôve never been heartbroken before and idk how to deal with these feelings. 
I really like her as a person and she and I were pretty good friends. 

   I guess what I‚Äôm asking for is some advice on how to deal with these feelings and if you think it would be feasible to repair out friendship?

"It is often said that trust is like a fragile glass to be handled with utmost care because one broken, it cannot be mended, and should you technically succeed in mending it, the scars never seem to go away. If concerted efforts are not made, if stringent measures are not taken on the part of the parties involved to mend as best as possible a broken trust, more wounds, sometimes even bigger tend to open up. 

   ""He/she does not trust me anymore, she does not trust me anymore despite all the efforts I've made to win back his trust, despite all the sacrifices I've made to make him realize I've changed"". How can he/she trust you when your motives are not genuine and sincere? When you keep making efforts and sacrifice simply to win back his or her trust? Actions are judged by intentions, by intended and not by extended outcome. How can he or she be sure that if he/she trusts you again, you will not betray him and break the newly established cord of trust again. As a matter of fact, chances are that you will than you won't. Instead of making efforts and sacrifices in other for him/her to trust you again, why don't you be very open enough and be who you truly are with him or her.  Let him/her know when he/she is doing things that tend to tempt you into doing things that will most likely make him/her not to trust you, even when he/she doesn't seem to be doing anything to push you to betray the little trust he/she has for you but somehow, for some reason you still feel like betraying him/her, let him/her know...

We started talking and I asked her out. we've been dating for a while so I decided to tell my bestie Ari, what Ari told me after I told her the news triggered me. She told me my girlfriend was dating a guy too. Later that day one of my friends told me she seen my girl kissing a different guy. I was furious so I wanted to settle things. I talked to my girl and she told me she's sorry, after that I broke up with her, after I told her that she broke into tears. Curse me and my good heart I gave her another chance. I caught her making out with another girl, I confronted her. I finally told her I was done, then I left.

two months later we were back together, I don't know how it happened, it just did. Things were perfect for a while, we wrote love notes to and gave each other gifts, that is until I found out from my best friend that she was holding a guy's hand. I talked to her then I decided I was done with this bullshit relationship. To this day we're still friends.",romance

"Not sure how to go about this really. Long story short: I met a girl online, we chatted for about a week or two before I asked if she wanted to get drinks, we met up at a bar near her place, had that ‚Äúaren‚Äôt first dates awkward‚Äù conversation, then we ended going back to her place to watch a movie, we smoked, we cuddled, one thing led to another and we ended up staying the night. We parted ways the next morning but stayed in touch throughout the following week. We decided to meet up to see a movie and cuddled a bit in the theater, but she didn‚Äôt invite me back to her place and we weren‚Äôt able to talk too much because of the movie. We‚Äôve been talking over text every day since, but it looks like we won‚Äôt be able to see each other until after next weekend. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what kind of advice I‚Äôm looking for here. We‚Äôve talked about what we‚Äôre both looking for and it seems like both of us are just trying to go with the flow and see where this leads. I‚Äôve only known her a little while but I think she‚Äôs really cool and interesting and would definitely be interested in pursuing whatever this is, but I‚Äôm afraid of coming off as clingy or crowding her. As it is, I‚Äôm trying to stop finding an excuse to text her everyday just so she can have a day or two break from me. Sidebar: can you tell I have low confidence? And poor social skills? And have never been in a real relationship before?

Basically: what are the next steps I should be taking to make sure I don‚Äôt screw things up and how can I keep her interested without coming off as needy?",romance

"Cheers awed a widow giving Thanksgiving turkey  
to two heirs, before leaving some stadium:  
&amp;nbsp;  
one, her son in proud camouflage,  
smiled at a young lady breastfeeding the other.  
&amp;nbsp;  
This soldier shared meat that shined her tongue  
&amp;nbsp;  
no sooner than the baby whined  
yet was disciplined between her gifting a strip  
and howling cadet whom lap  
&amp;nbsp;  
her giggle and hand caressed;  
howling as football runners,  
brave bulls thumping his tallest foes,  
broadening shoulders where she rested-  
&amp;nbsp;  
""Cyanide!""  
&amp;nbsp;Gloved hands  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;took the strip  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and his mother's  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;handcuff.

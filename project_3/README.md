# Introduction:
Discussions on Reddit are organized into user-created areas of interest called "subreddits". There are about 138,000 active subreddits among a total of 1.2 million, as of July 2018. As the amount of subreddits will continue to grow, we would like build a classifier model to help identify posts from different subbredits and guide user traffic to the appropiate subbredit.

# Executive Summary:
The reason to create this classifier model is so that we can help administrators to summarise a whole thread, suppress redundant or irrelevant posts. For contributers, it might provide guidance for increasing the usefulness of a contribution. For moderators, it might to act as a base model to identify things such as spam posts, misplaced posts, flame wars, troll users or threads that need locking, merging or deleting.

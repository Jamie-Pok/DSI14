"I'm very openly bisexual, and my friend ""Lily"" is straight.

A while ago my friend's bf, Mark, asked if I'd be interested in a threesome. He was very, very pushy about it and I was very uncomfortable. I told him that even if Lily was into women, he really wasn't my type and I don't see her that way since we've been friends since childhood.

He got really, really pissed off at me and said a bunch of very hurtful things about my looks, tattoos, job, lack of ""feminine attitude"" and other weird stuff. But worse, he's been telling our mutual friends that I'm some kind of predatory lesbian, that I won't leave Lily alone and am obsessed with her.

Lily refuses to take a side, and says he's just joking. But it's making me really uncomfortable and unhappy, and putting strain on our friendship.

What do I do?  He won't stop, I've asked him and he just called me a ""disgusting d\*ke"" and blocked me. Obviously I can't confront him in person at the moment.

tl;dr my bffs boyfriend got upset I turned him down for a threesome, and is now spreading nasty rumours about me  


Edit: to those people telling me to drop Lily. I see your point, however I'm very loath to do so because she's one of my oldest friends, and I'm worried about her. Mark has quite a few red flags (obviously), but she's pretty inexperienced in relationships and sex, and didn't see them. She doesn't get along with her family, so if things get worse, or his cruelty and control is turned on her (if it isn't already) I want to be someone she can come to. ",relationships

So it's been awhile since my original post so I figured I'd give a quick update. I took some advice I received on this post and decided we needed to take action. I couldn't stand having this guy be around anymore, receiving praise from his coworkers while none of them know what was truly happening. I talked with a few of my coworkers about it and we started looking into our options. Our company offers a hotline to report incidents just like this, completely anonymously. Finally, after a little bit of debate, one of us called the hotline and reported the incidents. We waited to see what would happen. Eventually the security team reached back out to him and asked him for more information. They said they are building a case and they need as much information as possible. After hearing this, the rest of the us decided to report our cases to further aid in the building of the case. I remember the security officer telling me that things are going to ""move quickly.""

Well I guess in a big company they don't fuck around with this. Less than a month after the initial report was filed the creepy asshole was fired. The entire department was told to meet in a meeting room real quick for some news and management laid it on us that he was gone. He was a highly respected coworker who was really good at his job. The news was met with shock, especially since some layoffs had occurred recently. I remember my heart absolutely racing when the news was being given. I couldn't believe that it was happening. I really didn't think some anonymous reports would lead to action so quickly. The creepy guy was friends with some of the women in our department, and he was texting them constantly saying that he was innocent. He quit pretty quickly once they weren't having any of what he was saying. The rumors of why he was fired spread really quickly around the office, but fizzled out faster than I was expecting. I really thought this would be going around the office for months, but after two weeks or so people stopped talking about it and things returned to normal.

I really appreciate the advice on here. It was extremely helpful in my decision, and it worked out for the best.

TLDR: If you want to take pictures of your coworkers in the bathroom and you like your job, then maybe reconsider. Coworker fired for this very thing after being reported.",relationships
"We’ve been together for 3 years. Recently he’s been acting suspicious (more time on his phone, quickly hides his screen, carries it on him everywhere) and putting out red flags. Basically classic signs of SOMETHING is going on. 

I straight up asked him to see his phone (I have never asked him before) and he refused adamantly. We were spending the day together. He then only let me see his phone a couple hours after he went “to the bathroom” and was in there for at least 15min. He handed me the phone but I gave it back. 

He obviously deleted some stuff while he was in the bathroom and I told him so. He accused me again of picking fights but I told him to take me home early. 

We’ve barley spoke since. Should I just break up with him and be done with it? I’ve been feeling paranoid and upset since then, but in the back of my mind what if he’s not doing anything and I’m ending a good relationship? 

I’ve caught him lying about stuff in the past (where he was at, and how late he is getting home but genuinely out with his friends). Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: Acting suspicious and wouldn’t let me see his phone. Now what?",relationships
"So this literally just happened. My husband walked out on me without his phone and took his car. I don’t know where he is, how to get in contact with him or what to do. I said “oh, fuck off” in a passive aggressive tone after repeatedly asking him to get out of my face and calm down. 

For some background info:

Married almost 1.5 years. 

Quarantine has been making him very agitated lately and will start fights with me over the smallest things. I think this fight started over me accidentally knocking something over which I’m prone to do. 

Has financial issues and refuses to get an actual job while trying to pursue his dream career - which I fully supported but he cannot contribute to bills and spends money like crazy. 

I have no family in this country and I cannot fly out. If I were to drive it would be over a day of straight driving and he controls the money. I don’t have access to online banking and barely anything in the account. 

No children, no pets. 

I have been an awful partner in the past but he holds onto all my wrong doings and even the small things now are very upsetting to him.

Lately I have felt the relationship take a more toxic turn and I’m not liking where it’s heading. I get blamed for basically *everything* and reminded of my many shortcomings. 

He’s never left without his phone like this before, I’m not even sure if he realized he left it.

Should I pack my things and leave while he’s out? Should I wait around for him to return and try to solve things? 

TL;DR Husband drove off. Have been fighting for a while on and off over small things around the house. Not sure what to do.

"My now ex boyfriend (32M) and I (29F) broke up last week. We haven't really talked until today. 

He came over with a list of things he said were positive and negative about me/our relationship. 

One of the negative things was that I've lost ambition, wasn't working out, and gained weight, so he lost attraction to me and didn't want sex. 

I'm so fucking hurt. It's quarantine and I've gain 10 lbs. I don't think it's that bad. I also have a bad back that I can't do anything about because it's expensive and now we are on lockdown, so it's nonessential. 

I just broke down crying. I've worked really hard to love myself and forget the negative voices in my head, but since he left my house its all I can hear, ""stupid, fat, ugly, loser"". 

He said that he didn't mean he wasn't attracted to me, but rather my lack of ambition was what was making him distance himself from me. 

But how am I supposed to ever believe that? If I went back to him I'd never feel comfortable eating in front of him. If we were to have sex again, all I'll be thinking is how he finds I'm disgusting. 

A few weeks ago, I made a comment that I gained some weight, but I wasn't really worried about it because I think I look fine and it won't take me long to lose it. I feel like he's using me saying that as a ""lack of ambition"". 

All he's been doing during quarantine is play video games. 

I just don't know what to do. I can't stop crying. I love him, but I can never unhear this.

Update: Thank you all for the advice. Just to be clear, I'm not really fat. He even told me that he can't tell I gained weight. He only knows because I told him I gained 10 lbs. I also gain weight pretty evenly. Secondly, I actually have been staying somewhat active. I've been walking almost every day and going on hikes. I can't do anything too rigorous because of my back, but I'm trying. I even repeatedly tried to get him to walk with me, but he said that he hated walks. I did get him to take one hike with me.  Again, thank you for the advice. 

Tldr; Ex BF came over and commented on my weight gain as lack of ambition and why our relationship went downhill. He still wants to work it out, but I'm not sure.",relationships
"My best friend and I have known each other since high school and have lived together all through college. She and her boyfriend started dating during high school and have been together for almost 5 years. A few months ago he allegedly blacked out from drinking and woke up in another girls bed the next morning not knowing how he got there. He found out from other people at the party that he slept with her multiple times that night, but claims he doesn’t remember anything. He told my friend the day after it happened and it crushed her. I loved this dude, I loved them together, I always thought he was so good to her and I never doubted that they would get married, and I still think they will. My problem is that I can’t get over the cheating, and it’s not even my relationship. I would hang out with them all the time and now I can’t even look him in the face. He absolutely disgusts me. They are still together and I don’t think they are going to break up, and as much as I despise him I will never ever ask my friend to choose between us... because I know she wouldn’t choose me. But I need to learn how to get past it because I can’t keep going on with this complete loathing I have for him. Any suggestions???

TLDR: my friends bf cheated on her, I hate him, how can I not hate him?",relationships
"I'll try to keep this brief because I'm prone to not keeping things brief. 

I (22f) moved back into my parents (60m and 59f) home because of corona, but also I just finished university and was going to move home anyways to save money. For the past 4 years, I've lived at home in the summer, and away for university for 8\~ months of the year (minus the occasional weekend home and reading breaks, etc.).  

Some context on me and my family: My parents are good people, and are ""cool"" compared to some of my friends' parents; I'd never been grounded, and they only ever pretended to care about underage drinking and smoking, and now that I'm an adult, they don't mind if I smoke (weed) in the backyard, and I can stay out as late as I want (obviously that's not happening now) – granted, my mom will still blow up my phone every 30m and then ask me plenty of questions when I do get home. When I'm not in uni, I work because I need money for student loans and school stuff, and spending money, but my parents pretty much bankroll me (tuition, I'm on their family phone plan, and now I am living with them again rent free, don't pay for groceries etc.). My family isn't rich (relative to where we live and who we know), but we certainly aren't poor, and they're very generous, so I am spoiled, and somewhat entitled (big respect to people who work hard for what they have, I know I'll have to eventually, but, like a spoiled child, I'm not in love with the idea). ~~Also I am already failing terribly at keeping this brief (I JUST THINK CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT).~~

OK so the issue is that, while I definitely have my flaws, when I am living away from home, I am fairly well-adjusted and definitely not an angry or moody person and I very, very rarely get snappy or genuinely mean with my friends/peers. BUT, living with my parents for more than 2 days and I immediately regress back into my 14 year old self! Picking fights with my mom over basically nothing (even if I am truly ""right"" about whatever we're arguing about, there did not need to be a fight, nor do I need to act and talk like a bratty, moody teenager) and, I guess, taking out some of my anger on her through these fights. Granted, this isn't all me, as my mom is prone to (negative) overreactions and excessive worrying (and I feel for her on that front, but when you live with it, it gets old reeeeeal fast) and taking her bad moods out on me and my dad passive aggressivey. But anyways, my mom is overall pretty great and does a lot for us, and we do get a long really well a decent amount of the time, I just don't want to keep having these outbursts with her. She just annoys me so much! Sometimes for good reason, and mostly for no reason at all, and the littlest things will make me angry (but I have no clue what the trigger(s) is/are). I guess a lot of the stuff with my mom can be explained by the fact that most young adults do experience friction with their parents as they get older and used to more independence, and do tend to regress when spending a lot of time with their parents, but I would still like any advice/insight as to why I am like this, and how to be better to my mom.

And y'all thought this post was over... no it's not, because I have recently learned that Daddy Issues come in many flavours other than divorced dad, absentee dad, and overall really shitty dad flavours! So about my good ol' pop. Before I hit puberty, we got along great. I think I used to look up to him a lot because I thought he was very smart (and he is smart) and very funny (dad humour is unironically fantastic to children). It's worth noting that I am a lot like my dad in many ways, and while I obviously am like my mom in plenty of respects, I am my father's daughter (and vice versa for my older brother). Of course, once I became a tween and a teen, we got along less good, as is typical (or so I hear). And now that I am a young woman, we get along terribly. Not all the time, most of the time we get along fine or at least peacefully. But when we don't... oof. I can't even get into confrontations with my dad without crying, he just makes me feel so small so fast (whether or not that's intentional? I doubt it, but maybe). His opinion is always the correct one, ""because it is"", and he can pretty much never admit when he's wrong. We mostly connect to each other through music and TV. On the TV front, we like a lot of the same shows, and when we don't like the same shows it's fine because we can just watch in private. Music, however, is somehow his domain, and god forbid my mom or I try to play any of our music in the car or around the house. If you listen to something he personally doesn't like? Well then it's bad! No sense in telling him that there is no ""good"" or ""bad"" music because \*subjectivity\*, if he says it's bad then, obviously, it must be! This sucks because we do connect over a lot of (his) music, but most of the music I like I'm embarrassed to play around him because I know he's going to make fun/judge (almost exclusively negatively). This is only one example, but it's definitely the most relevant and a good one. I know, logically, that I'm right in that his opinion of things I do or enjoy doesn't matter, and that his opinion of me only matters as much as I want it to, but emotionally it's really frustrating! I'm 22, I don't want to feel like some little girl striving for daddy's approval! And honestly, I'm not, most of the fights we get into are me arguing against him about something, I contradict him ALL THE TIME. He just can't be wrong (classic Dad thing, though). The other thing is that he's sort of turning into an old crank. My parents are mostly progressive (we support our country's main ""leftist"" party), and my older brother and I are big time progressive. But lately my dad has really been trying to ""push the envelope"" in the stuff he says and the jokes he makes around me. Pretty sure he's doing it to get a rise out of me (because I'm, for lack of a better term, a SJW). But he's called my brother and I ""pathetic"" for being so angry about everything all the time (as if we don't have our whole lives ahead of us to deal environmental and societal issues, vs. him facing retirement), and told us that he was going to spoil his ballot in our last election because he's ""fed up with politics"" (SIR, ME TOO, BUT I STILL HAVE A FUTURE TO VOTE FOR?!?!?). We don't know if he was serious about that, but sometimes it feels like he's trying to punish us for caring so loudly. It's like he's annoyed with me all the time, which I would be able to deal with if he didn't make it so obvious, and if him showing didn't make me feel like either I'm out of line OR that I shouldn't have said anything. I know he loves me, and I love him, but it honestly feels like he resents me sometimes.

One last note, and I'll make it ~~very~~ brief (for real this time): I HATE being vulnerable around my parents. I'll do it if I have to, or if it's not super emotional/vulnerable (like asking for friendship advice or something). I know they love me, and I love them, but if I'm ever in any sort of emotional distress, they are probably some of the last people I would want to know/talk to. I do, however, have a much easier time talking about that stuff with my mom, and have done it before without it feeling like torture. Don't know how relevant this is or how it plays into the other issues, but I don't doubt it does. 

Well, this is really long, and super incoherent. If you read this, wow! Thank you! And if you scrolled past it, yep, that's fair.

TL;DR My mom annoys me so much sometimes, how do I stop snapping at her and being rude/a moody teenager around her? AND my dad thinks his opinion is fact and routinely makes me feel belittled and expresses annoyance at me for daring to express myself/argue against him (when my argument is sound, he flusters and deflects and gets angry). How do I stop caring about his opinion so much? And how do I not feel so small around him when we do end up in debates/arguments/confrontations?   
In general, how can I stop acting like a moody 14 year old while living with my parents, and show them that I'm not a ""bitch"" (their words not mine! even if they have a point (they do), I'm not a fan of women being called bitches in most contexts) like they ~~always? sometimes?~~ think, and am actually capable of being nice and getting through conversations like an adult? (Aside from helping out around the house more, which I need to do! And once I have income I will pitch in on some of the bills as well). And, reddit, am I an asshole for being kind of asshole around my parents?",relationships
"Married 2 years. This past year has been very stressful (I mean everything from getting laid off to his brother dying to his mom being diagnosed with cancer). Money is tight and he's been trying to do a specific type of website for a company (it's basically a trial....if he does a good job they have a lot of work for him, so it's very important that he is successful).  

&amp;#x200B;

I work part-time and was going to school part-time, but right now I'm working part-time from home. I try to keep things chill for him around here. I do all the cleaning and I cook his favourite meals. 

&amp;#x200B;

But he's struggling with the website. So a lot of the time he's having a hard time getting something to work properly and since a lot is riding on this project, he'll have a mini-tantrum.  An example:

**Me:** (washing dishes while husband is working at the kitchen table, and we'd just finished happily chatting about something)

**Him:**  (loudly shouting) FUUUUUCK!!!!!! 

**Me:** what happened??

**Him:** I can't get this fucking thing to work. (insert a bunch of tech words I don't understand). Fuck this! Just leave me the fuck alone.

**Me:** silent

**Him:** You know, I'm trying so hard to get this shit working so we can have some money around here. You mope around acting miserable all the fucking time (*news to me).* If you can see I'm struggling with something (*I couldn't)* then how about be fucking quiet instead of standing there washing the fucking dishes? Do you ever think of that? 

He then storms off. He comes back about 10 minutes later, contrite and apologizes for being an ass. Tells me he's so lucky to have me, thanks me for understanding him.

I've told him I don't care if he has freak outs.....but I care that he finds ways to blame me for stupid things (or he'll bring up something random such as the fact that my books are in his way). He still does it and he gets mad like this often.

Is this just chalked up to stress? Or huge red flags?

"I've been with my girlfriend since October, and we both very much want to be together for the long term. Due to the virus, we are currently separated by several states. However, she has a fairly high sex drive. While this is normally not a problem, it has now gotten to the point where she still craves something physical rather than anything over text. She's proposing that we both hookup with someone in our area to help relieve the tension. She already has someone in mind, but has reassured me that she's only interested because I can't be there physically. I'm not sure how I feel about this. 

We both agree that we want to be together and that the only problem currently is distance. I'm afraid that if we try this things might not be the same when we can be together again. I don't want her to be unsatisfied, but much moreso I don't want to lose her. What should I do?

Throwaway because my wife knows my main reddit user. 
My wife and I have been together for 2.5 years and married for 6 months. We didn’t live together until we married as she comes from a traditional family. We are adjusting well to married life. 

However there’s one slight issue, she has always been an emotional person on her period, which I understand as ive grown up around 2 sisters. 
However the issue is a little awkward for me. She grew up in a very conservative family, not necessarily religious but very conservative and traditional that made her believe in no sex before marriage. A year or so before she met me she fell off with an ex she says her first time was very strange and that consent was somewhat questionable. I know that she then slept with a colleague a few times. I don’t necessarily like that she wasn’t in a relationship with him but I wouldn’t express that to her, I’ve always made clear we don’t need to discuss our pasts as we both have one and we should focus on the now. 


But since we’ve been married each time she’s on her period she gets super teary and cries that she ‘ didn’t wait for me ‘ and that the other two dudes weren’t nearly as special as me. I told her not to be silly that it’s happened and it’s fine. it literally puts her in a funk and makes the whole atmosphere awkward especially as were quarantining. I’ve told her that she should see a therapist but she seems reluctant. I don’t know if it’s because money is super tight right now. 

Is there anything more I can do? 

I don’t really know what to do as it’s not a topic I want to necessarily discuss as it’s all in the past.

"Hi

As a result of pre-natal spinal trauma, I have had a disability since birth which has left me sexually impotent all my life (I am now 18). The disability had several other effects; however, as most of these were obvious (e.g., inability to walk; severe constipation), I had numerous surgeries as a child which were, for the most part, fairly successful, leaving me with a fairly decent standard of living. Perhaps because the doctors didn't expect my sexual function to be inhibited by the disability, or perhaps because my parents never asked the relevant questions (who asks if a three-year-old will be able to have sex?), this was never mentioned during any appointments.

As a quick summary, I can get hard, though this happens pretty randomly, and I can ejaculate, though this provides no pleasure, almost always happens when I'm soft, and normally happens during a bowel movement. I also urinate using a catheter in a hole on the side of my abdomen, so, aside from when I wash and get changed, I don't give my member much thought. 

I realised that I was different sexually when I found out that other guys can 'get it up' at will; for the first few years, I really didn't care, and put it down to being asexual. After a while, I realised I was straight and rejected that hypothesis, and briefly thought it was a hormonal issue (I'm also very short), before deciding it was likely due to my disability, and eventually brought it up with one of the specialists who has treated me since infancy. However, I chickened out to some of his questions, and he thought my sexual functioning was better than it actually is. I, as an adult, now have a new specialist, with whom I was more honest, and it looks as though a surgery would be able to make my sexual function more normal, providing extra sensation and, likely also, ability. The operation is pretty low-risk for somebody of my age, and the recovery time is relatively short. 

My main concern is that, seeing how sex-obsessed so many of my male friends are, I'd be distracted from those things I value in my day-to-day life, particularly academia, where I have excelled largely because of my single-minded focus on the subject. At the same time, I have been ingrained with the idea that meaning in life comes from following the standard path (marriage, kids, etc), and, whatever its flaws, I still value this motif highly. However, this operation would just remove one of many, many obstacles I face in having a happy relationship, and could make me less happy if I became significantly sexually frustrated for a long time. 

I would have brought this up with a male member of my family, but my closest grandfather died a few years ago, and my terminally-ill father and is incapacitated, and these circumstances have made familial relations tense. I'd be very grateful if people could provide advice on whether you think I should undertake this operation (presumably after the lock-down ends). 

TL;DR! Due to a life-long disability, I have no sexual function, and I'm at a crossroads whether to undergo an operation which could alleviate this.",relationships
"My partner(25) &amp; me (25) have only been together 6 months. I'll give a brief relationship history. Last boyfriend, toxic, stalker, my baby daddy I was with for 5 years beat me badly and often, before that cheated on, etc. I stayed single for almost a year to clear my head, work on myself and heal, build myself back up again. It was such hard work but i felt comfortable single.

My current boyfriend (24) I've been seeing for only 6 months. I've known him for 2 years though as friends. Well, I thought I knew him. Trouble is I am naive and stupid when it comes to men, I have never had any man in my life treat me well and I desperately want that &amp; to have a family. It was just me &amp; my son before we got together &amp; now it's the three of us &amp; I found out that I am pregnant with his child. He was living in Poland when we got together &amp; he left his girlfriend and 2 kids to come to me, which I thought was romantic and special at the time.

Since we got together it has been so unbelievably toxic &amp; I'm struggling badly right now &amp; I feel so stupid. He got me addicted to drugs &amp; alcohol, he trashed my house &amp; left me homeless and my son was taken off me. He was texting his ex girlfriend for months saying he was in love with her &amp; that he will be moving back to Poland to her. He told me he did this because I was depressed. He broke up with me for one day &amp; slept with a prostitute because I was texting my male friend. I had to stop talking to all men, yet he tells me constantly that I am controlling. He used to leave, say he'd be back in 20 minutes and not come back for 2 days, ignore my calls, texts, etc. He has almost overdosed 3 times where I literally have saved his life.

Im pregnant and found it hard to come off drugs, he is spending 3+ days a week on drugs and drinking &amp; im crying all the time. I cant deal with looking at him take drugs under my nose. He hasn't had a job &amp; has given very little money since he got here. If I try to talk about anything at all he gets so mad at me &amp; tells me not to talk to him. If I tell him how I feel he says dont talk about that or you're going to make me in a bad mood.

In fairness to him he has changed considerably since he found out I'm pregnant but not enough. He says I am lucky because this is him being good, that he used to do very bad things to his ex's. I have his ex dragging my name in the dirt around my town, saying im a junkie &amp; I stole her man, Im a slut, etc. She said she hopes my child dies of coronavirus. He has court soon &amp; could be locked up for up to 3 years.

I dont know how I manage to do this to myself, pick men like this &amp; it is so hard because this one is s real charmer, he is gorgeous &amp; when we do get along its the most intense, amazing relationship Ive ever experienced. It's upsetting because if he wasnt like this we would be so perfect together &amp; that breaks my heart. I dont know what to do, I dont want to be a single parent at 25 with an 8 year old &amp; a newborn baby I dont know if I would cope but this situation is so toxic &amp; nothing I say or do will change him, hi main problem being addiction. I wasnt expecting this pregnancy, I have the bar in my arm. Its a lose, lose situation for me &amp; I am so stuck &amp; lost right now. This should be a special time but I'm crying constantly &amp; losing my sanity a bit.

Should I leave him?

I'm scared of leaving because I don't have any other support &amp; my son has aspergers &amp; serious anger issues and I'm worried that I won't be able to do it alone.

My boyfriend hasn't treated me great, he has done a lot of bad to me but I recently found out I'm pregnant with his baby but he is causing me so much stress &amp; upset I dont know if I should leave him or not",relationships
"I am eva and m 28 , I don't know how to write this post but here it goes- so I have a friend more like a sister, have known her for the past 2 year. She has helped me in my every problem but from the last 3 months things have went rather downhill. Everything went south from the moment when we both competed for the same educational programme and I got selected when meant she did not. She went bitter after that stopped talking to me altogether, avoided me in college and hostel. As per her she was deserved the selection as her CV was better than mine and her guide added to the fuel by backing up this statement. I tried talking to her and apologized to her even though I firmly believe that I wasn't wrong and I deserved it. I apologized to her and told her that if you feel so, you even can drop a mail to the selection committee and ask for an explanation, as to why you weren't selected. Anyways what happened next was that she suddenly started talking to me but after that things have awkward between us. I know she's been talking behind my back and this has made my other friends who were quiet judge and critical of me. I have tried to make things normal with her again, have tried to tell her that I still love her the very same way and want her back her as my friend. Please all suggestions are welcomed as to what I can do to make things go back to normal ?

"So This Girl and I (Currently 2000Km apart but go to the same uni) started texting for an assignment for our uni class. We have since (past 6 weeks) been texting for about an hour or 2 a week plus a few video calls here and there. I usually initiate the conversations but she has started them from time to time. She is really supportive and kind and has a ton of similar interests. But, I can't read her. I don't know if she likes me as a friend or romanticly and I don't want to screw it up like I have with past relationships. We have plans to hang out after we are back from isolation but I don't know how she sees me. I want to date her and I really like her and don't know how to read the situation without being in person.

"\* Created an account for anonymous quandaries

Below is my version of the scenario. I'm keen to know what other people have done if they've found themselves wondering this question.

I've (22 M) been in a very loving relationship with my girlfriend (21 F) for 2.5 years. When things are great (which is most of the time) she feels like the person I want to spend my life with. She's very kind, funny, cuddly and extremely beautiful, my days of being single ended instantly after we met each other.

When we have disagreements I find her process difficult. I don't like arguing, I like to move on quickly but she doesn't let things go so easily or recognise that it isn't worth an argument. I feel like I get dragged into an argument because she is upset about something that she can't let go so she starts to talk about it in a way that makes me feel the need to defend myself. This leads to argument and short periods where we are upset with each other and it happens more often than I would like. In the past this has been much worse, she has anxiety and has recently learned to control it much better. 

This is my first and only relationship so I have no point of comparison. I sometimes wonder if I should stay with my girlfriend,  maybe things will change as we grow older maybe they won't or should I look for someone I don't get upset with frequently. I look at my sister or my parents relationships and they never get upset with each other as often as my partner and I do.

TLDR; Would you settle for a relationship with a person you really love that is great most of the time but has frequent difficulties or should you keep looking for a relationship that fufils you all the time?",relationships
"This is kinda weird because I never really use reddit, but I didn’t know who to talk to about this situation. My boyfriend and I have been dating for three and a half years, and recently moved in together. I discovered that my my boyfriend locks himself in the bathroom to “poop” but actually just goes in there while I’m asleep or busy with something, to watch porn. We talked about it and he just says he’s in the mood just to watch porn and not to have sex. 
 
At first it kinda bothered me and I’ve tried to not think too much into it, but now he does it more frequently. The other day we had finished having  sex and I went about my day. He was still in the room laying on the bed naked and I had found that kinda weird since he usually just gets up and plays his games or watches tv. When I walked in he was watching porn. I got bothered because now I feel like sex doesn’t satisfy him so he needs to watch other people to feel better. 
  
It makes me feel like every time he is in the bathroom he is going to do it and watch porn or when he’s by himself. Our sex life isn’t the greatest, every time I ask if he does want to have sex he never wants to or is never in the mood, but he is always in the mood to masturbate. I understand that’s privacy because everyone does it, but it’s making me feel insecure about myself, like I don’t satisfy him. Should I be worried or am I overreacting? 

TL;DR my boyfriend sometimes goes to the bathroom and watches porn, I’m worried",relationships

So everyone was right about my boyfriend. That wasn't the last time he did something like this. He did worst things but no need to get into more details. 

The problem here is that my situation is the same. I have no job and in my country it's very difficult to find one. I have nowhere to go. I guess I could go with my parents but I'd rather stay with him than my mother. I'm lost at this moment and I feel like I'm walking on glass. When translated literally this expression makes no sense, sorry. But I just have to be so careful about everything. I thought about asking help on a shelter but I'm not sure they are going to help me and also I feel like my situation isn't that bad to go and ask help. So I don't know. 

For now the only thing I can do is wait. He isn't always so aggressive. I don't know what's going on or what makes him act the way he does sometimes. I mean the situation isn't that bad but I'm always tired and afraid and I hate feeling like this. When I wake up in the morning and he is gone to work I feel so relieved. But the days he works from home I just don't know what to do. Most days everything is fine but then something will happen to him and because he is with me he'll direct that anger to me. 

I'm just waiting until everything is back to normal so I can plan how to get out. I really wanted to give him a chance to probe that him breaking my phone was a thing that he would only do once but that's not the case. 

TL;DR My boyfriend is abusive and everyone was right. But I can't really leave him because I have no job and nowhere to go so my situation is the same.

Edit: I don't know why this post got blocked but I was reading the answers on my last post and I realize how dumb I seemed defending him.",relationships
"My (34F) boyfriend (39M) won’t leave me alone and I’m starting to get really upset and angry. He’s a mature student so works from home anyway and my job doesn’t exist anymore so we’re locked in at home together. He spends his whole day playing computer games and neglects to do any of his important coursework. I don’t get on his case about it as I know that it’s stressful. I do my best to encourage and support him but he doesn’t do the same for me. Even letting him have an entire room on our flat to have as a private workspace (which I don’t have).

Now I’m at home I’m trying to get on with my own personal projects. I spend a lot of time reading and studying things I’m interested in such as art and design. I’m currently planning a wedding sculpture I want to build to add to my portfolio which could lead to paid work in the future. However as he has the main office and our home is only small I’ll often do this sat up in bed or on the sofa as my laptops rather big and it’s the only way to get comfortable if I’m working for a long time. Quite often he’ll burst in and start ranting about something or another (not important personal stuff but like a game he’s been playing or his dislike of a politician etc). I’m happy to chat to him but I chat to him 24 hours a day. I try to tell him hey I’m busy can we discuss this later but he just doesn’t ever stop and it’s getting downright disrespectful. 

Last night I was sleeping and he came to bed ranting about Nicola Sturgeon and so I had to tell him to please stop so I can sleep. This morning I woke up early and was pleased to have some peace and quiet while he was asleep. I sat up in bed reading until about 8am when he woke up. He immediately started going on at me saying I should go out and get some excercise. I agree with him and say yes but right now I’m really getting into this instruction book because I’m planning this project etc. please let me get on with it. He refused to stop. He then started telling me I was morbidly obese (I’m overweight but not obese by any standard, HE however is). I say yes, WE need to excercise more. How about later today but right now I’m doing this so please let me get on with it. He started ranting how he’s not overweight and it’s me but won’t stop even if I make it clear that I’ve already agreed to go excercise. I tell him look I’m getting angry now. I’m busy, I’m trying to concentrate, please leave me alone. He refuses. He will just stand there and won’t stop badgering me. I started to get really upset and keep pleading for him to please go away but he’ll stand in the door refusing to leave. It gets to the point where I’m getting really angry and I need to go calm down. I tried to push past him to leave but I slipped and twisted my ankle. It’s not actually his fault but it wouldn’t have happened if he’d have just left me alone when I asked him to. He’s apologised but I’m really upset.

I feel like he doesn’t regard my work or interests with any degree of importance. He’ll often come and disturb me when I’m clearly concentrating. He’ll do this even when he knows I’m working and my income depends on it. I get stressed out and end up giving up but I can’t even sit and watch tv in peace and I’m exhausted. I don’t ever do this to him although playing computer games while he’s supposed to be studying is a disastrous use of his time but I’m not his mother. 

He’ll go as far as interfering to the point that  it’s dangerous. I’ve had to ban him from the kitchen because he’ll start ranting I’m not doing it right and start shoving hot pans around which is dangerous. He’ll accidentally break something then start getting on my case about how Im clumsy and not being safe around the house. Honestly I’m starting to crack up. 

The only short term solution is I install locks inside of all the rooms so I can be left alone. It’s not like I can go sit in a library or cafe anymore but I feel like I shouldn’t have to. 

TL;DR

My boyfriend is disrespectful of my time. He nags and micromanages me which I find insulting. He won’t leave me alone when I’m asking him for space and I’m starting to get really upset about it. We’re in lockdown together, what can I do?",relationships
"So I'm going to start off with some context behind my family. I live with my mum, step dad, brother and step brother (although he's basically a brother). I've never really been close with my family, I'm quite a introverted person and like my own space. I think this is mainly down to the toxic nature of my family. Our family aren't very close and my parents can be quite selfish as I'll go on to talk about.

I'm in a lucky enough position to be able to work from home during this time. My job involves a lot of communication. Phone calls and work that does require silence around me. My parents are ""key workers"" here in the UK so technically my brothers [16 &amp; 13] could be at school.

My step brother [13] has always been a loud and annoying person, he gets his own way and shouts and screams, he's basically treated like a baby and the king of the household. My parents will bend over backwards to ensure his happiness.

So anyway now that's explained. Work obviously hasn't just stopped so I have had to work as normal, which is relatively busy, as work is. So since this started I did ask for respect from my family and to just watch the volume of their voices as I'll be on the phone a lot. Which they understood and agreed. However as you could imagine, it's been hell and everyone is constantly shouting at each other and as usual my step brother is shouting and screaming and crying constantly. This in turn is affecting my job as I can't bear being in calls anymore and constantly on edge. I have to keep myself on mute most of the time so I can't contribute to the conversation etc. This is in turn affecting my mental health. I suffer with anxiety and depression anyway. (I'm on medications)

I have had multiple ""adult"" (loose term as they aren't very adult) conversations with my parents about how I just need a bit of silence between 9-5 as I am working and so are they. I made the point that if they were at school and out at work it would be quiet here anyway and they should be working. (Neither of them have done any school work during this time) Everyone has to be quiet when they're working but that respect isn't mutually transmitted to me. 

More examples include I had an important presentation to do the other day and I got so mad and anxious that I just had to scream at my family to shut up so I can present in front of important people before I did it. My parents didn't care (linking back to the selfishness) 

My mum coming in and out of my room as she pleases. No respect there. Doesn't even knock.

I just don't know what to do and it's really starting to push me over the edge. I don't want to work anymore, when I'm not working I'm sleeping as I just can't bear it anymore. 

Am I being selfish?

Any advice would be so greatly appreciated. Created an anonymous account too for this just fyi.

"Long distance relationship of almost 2 years, we're in our early 20's. We see each other once a month when possible. The first year went perfectly, last months not so much because of issues on both sides. We fought a lot and at times weren't convinced of the relationship, but we understood it's the distance that makes us feel this way (fuck covid btw).

I want to preface this by saying that she's never broken my trust, she's never given me a reason not to trust her, she's open, honest and doesn't have time to play games with people, so she would never string someone along. Whenever we're together she doesn't act secretively around her phone, she leaves it unlocked, even hands it over to me sometimes and it's pretty clear that she has nothing to hide.

Still, for a week now she's been going to bed at 3 AM, sometimes even later. Nothing wrong with that, we're in quarantine, we're bored, she often has trouble sleeping, so the time is not the issue. But every time I wake up earlier than her, I send her a good morning message and can't help but notice that her ""last seen"" on whatsapp is always at 3 AM or later. That shouldn't be a big deal though, because she might be checking whatsapp late at night just before going to bed, right?

No, because since mid-march her whatsapp activity has spiked: I see her online all day long, she's always on whatsapp and even when we text at night, yeah, she replies to me, but she keeps bouncing back and forth between different chats, THE WHOLE TIME we're talking. So my gut tells me she's been texting someone else for two months now, and has progressed to the phase of talking until late at night.

It might be a friend, it might be anyone. All I know is that she was never online that much before, except when talking to me, and whenever she couldn't sleep she'd tell me goodnight and maybe browse OTHER social media platforms for hours. Whatsapp is for chatting only: if you're constantly checking it, it's surely not because you're browsing posts, it's because you're chatting with someone.

At first she would send me a message like ""I can't sleep"" or ""I'm having trouble sleeping again"" at like 2 AM, maybe because she knew I'd see her ""last seen"" and she wanted to justify the fact that she was online that late (?) who knows. After a while she stopped doing this anyway.

*(I feel like I have to specify one thing, since I've seen this so many times on this subreddit: whatsapp itself is not a sign of cheating, at least not in our country. Every person in our country has it, even old ladies).*

I know it might be a quick jump to a wrong conclusion, I don't have any proof except a thing she said to me during a fight, but she was pissed off and under stress at the time and she tends to say nasty stuff when angry. She said, among other things, ""what I'm not finding in you, I'm starting to look for in other people"". Of course she apologized that same day blah blah blah, but she still said it. I know it sounds pretty bad, and like a possible red flag, but I don't have the time and space to give you the full context and it's one of those cases where ""it's bad but not as bad as it sounds"".

Other than these three things (that episode, her online activity and my gut feeling), I have no proof and I can't afford to bring this up again. I already did once in March and a second time in April and both times it led to her telling me she was talking to her best friend (hmmmmm) and then an argument.

I have no reason either to bring this up, because she's acting affectionate with me, reacts well, we laugh and talk normally, we sext, she tells me she loves me and misses me in many different ways (subtle or not) and trust me, if she doesn't feel love towards a person, she doesn't even bother telling them, so I know that when she says it she means it 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** ldr gf of almost 2 years goes to bed really late at night. That paired with the fact that she's really really active online makes me think she's texting with someone else until 3 AM every night. Still, she's never broken my trust and is acting ""like a girlfriend"" (loving, caring, funny, cute, etc) towards me. My gut tells me bad stuff, as always.

"My boyfriend and I were together for almost five years. We love each other so much and had (have?) incredible chemistry. When things were good, they were really good. Sadly, things got rocky for us in late 2019; I started developing feelings for someone else (nothing physical happened but we became emotionally close. Before things escalated I told the third party to back off) and he outright cheated on me one time with another girl. Note - this is not the first time he cheated. The first incident happened in 2015 but he also came clean and I took him back. 

I broke up with him in January 2020. Then, I felt set on my decision. He continued talking to me over chat and I would sometimes respond. We would have brief conversations. I couldn't find it in me to block him. He always begged me to take him back. 

Over the course of this pandemic, we started talking more often and my heart got soft. Up until the last week of April he still said he wanted to fix things. On May 3rd, I told him yes, let's just start over. 

He then says that he's not sure. He says he realized that while he still loved me very much, he was torn between me and his newfound freedom. I could see on his social media that he was talking to new girls, and anyway we were both open about using dating apps. When, back then, this didn't bother me, now I found myself becoming hurt and jealous. 

I'm so torn. I fell in love with him all over again over the month of April and now I want him back. He says he still loves me but he needs time to decide. He says that over the course of the breakup, he started talking to new people to cope with the heartbreak, and that I can't just expect him to undo all the emotional conditioning he put himself through. Nevetheless a part of him also wants to be with me. He's been trying to decide for more than a week now. 

Is it reasonable for me to wait? Am I delusional?

"Alright so here it goes... I am a 31 yo m soldier in the US Army, currently stationed in FH Texas. A couple months ago I discovered my wife was cheating on me while I was in Korea. But it goes so much further than that.. Here's a back story so you can get a wider view of the situation. My wife suffers from mutiple issues, some mental some physical, we were drowning in medical bills so I talked it over with my wife and decided joining the Military would be our best course of action to resolve our debt problem and provide ourselves with a better life. 3 days prior upon returning from deployment I called my wife to let her know I was going to be home in a couple days, to which she told me one of her friends was at the house helping her with her seziure episodes, which I thought was strange of her to not tell me he was there when he arrived.. but ok. I understood. So I get home and over the course of a couple days I could tell something was going on between them by the way they would look at each other or moods would shift when they came in contact so after dropping this guy off at the airport I asked her if anything happened between them to which of course she replied no but I've been with her for 10 years and can tell when she lies.. the next day I start digging. I eventually found photos she had deleted from her phone that confirms my suspicion. When confronted she admitted to it, a couple hours pass and I decided that I still wanted to be with her, that we could work this out thinking it was a one-time thing. When speaking to her she was being kinda emotionless about the whole thing which led me to ask her if she cared about what she had done to which she replied no.. (this is what broke me..) I told her she needed to leave, turns out she was already planning to in 3 months, (which hurt me even more..) after her sister drove out from California to get her I found her HDD which had even more evidence dating back to when I was almost out of basic.. (that was the soul crushing part..) I'm not perfect but I loved her for everything she was and I changed my entire life for her needs. Its been months and still can't put myself together. She is now refusing to talk to me, it's been over a month since we have spoken to each other. I've all but given up on getting closure at this point. But how do I pick up the pieces?? I'm doing the best I can but every time I sit down my mind wanders back to her. How do I move past this?? 

Here's some back story on this guy and my wife.. he's 19. My wife is 28. He doesn't have a job and still lives with his mom. From the photos and videos he is unattractive with a penis the size of my pinki (no joke).. Also while I was in basic my wife ran up 5k in debt maxing out all of our credit cards which I found out later about 75% was from drinking at bars and buying alcohol.. she wasn't perfect, I know. But I accepted the debt and moved past that before deployment.

I wasn't perfect but I know I wasn't a bad husband.. I gave her effection, I bought her flowers on a regular, I gave her hand written cards every birthday and every Christmas. I just don't understand why she would do this.. and why with someone like him... I still love her more than anything but I know I can't take her back, I know even if she apologized I wouldn't be able to look at her the same for years.

I can't tell anyone either, Can't file for divorce yet because I'll lose the house and have to live in the barracks if I do.

So yeah.. Have any advice Reddit? I could really use it.

"So my girlfriend (20F) and I (20M) have been in a relationship for almost 5 months. Ever since this quarantine and me not being able to see her all the time, I’ve found that I’ve been acting like a child and getting mad over the little things and becoming toxic. 

How can I change this? So that I don’t give my girlfriend an excuse to leave. I just wanna be a great boyfriend so that she won’t have thoughts of leaving me. She almost broke up with me because I was pushy and she felt like she couldn’t talk to her friends without me being all in her business.

"We have been together for a year. 

Early in our relationship, he threw off a few red flags, little ones, saying he was a bit possessive and showing some jealousy issues. My friends weren’t cool with him and advised me to stop dating him so I was a bit more secretive about seeing him. I still told them I was dating him but said we weren’t official when we were which was a mistake. 

Around this time I went to a wedding and met someone who is in the same job as me and a mutual friend of the groom. We talked as we’re both in the same profession but nothing happened and there was no flirting. Unfortunately one of my friends texted another friend with a photo of the two of us sitting next to each other, saying cute couple or something. We exchanged numbers as he wanted a playlist of mine and left it at that. I honestly had no intentions beyond that. 

The guy texted me the text day implying he was interested. I told him I had a boyfriend and that was that, he didn’t message again. 

My friend on the other hand, texted me for details asking who the guy in the picture was and that he was cute. She asked if there were vibes and I agreed he was cute but because I was dating (current bf), I wasn’t interested and wasn’t going to do anything. She then proceeded to get annoyed at me, saying we weren’t exclusive and he has so many red flags and I shouldn’t be closing off my options etc. I awkwardly made up more excuses and then eventually it stopped. I then told her a few weeks later that we were official and I had been hiding it etc. 

So my bad here was hiding the seriousness of the rs from my friends, but I didn’t cheat, flirt or overstep any boundaries. However, my bf decided to snoop through my phone one day when I was driving (!) and saw messages with friend. 

He has now constantly accused me of being a cheater. He keeps saying I’m a cheater despite the fact I never even flirted with the dude. I agree I was wrong to not be clearer with my friend but I DID tell her that I was dating (current bf) and therefore not interested. However he’s not having it. He keeps saying I’m a cheater and I probably flirted with the guy at the wedding and I’m a cheater. That’s despite him seeing the texts with the guy and my friend. He claims that I must have been flirting with that guy for him to express any interest. Even though I did not flirt with him at all. And also that me saying there might have been vibes was cheating, even though the context was that I shut down any vibes BECAUSE of him. 

He KEEPS saying I flirted with the guy when I know I didn’t. Obviously he wasn’t there so I can’t prove anything but I just didn’t at all - in fact he was so awkward with me at the wedding I didn’t even consider he might be interested. I’m getting exhausted saying this only to be called a liar and a cheater. “Why would he text you trying to flirt if you hadn’t flirted with him at the wedding?” - hmm because that’s what he did and he was awkward?? I immediately said I had a boyfriend and to stop which my boyfriend is ignoring. 

I’m so tired of being called a cheater. I know I should’ve been more open about the rs but I even told my friend I was dating him and immediately shut down any flirting from wedding guy so it’s like I’m being punished for the wrong thing. It really hurts me as well having been cheated on before. I’ve tried to explain so many times and he just isn’t having it. What can I do?

**tldr** For a short period at the beginning of my rs i downplayed the seriousness of it to my friends.

"Married 7 years.  He is somewhat of an inventor (and always has been since a kid). That's his thing. Always has a project on the go. When we first got together I listened with fascination to all of his ideas. I spent considerable time helping him work on some of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

First there was the ""dog thrower"" contraption. It sounded so fun! Spent hours and hours driving around, getting parts and trying them out, driving around and getting different parts, putting everything together, starting from scratch etc. Then it got really busy and work and he had hit a snag with the contraption so it was shelved.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there was the second idea. That one actually advanced to him hiring a couple of freelancers to work on it in the evenings in the garage. He put a lot of money into it (this is before we married) and the freelancer couldn't meet a deadline. Then the investor pulled out. Then, then, then....in the end this idea is just (very expensive) parts stored in our garage. Even though freelancers were working on it, I spent considerable time helping, sourcing, as a go-between, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It's gone on like that for years. One idea after another. They are often good ideas but he can't bring them to fruition. Plus he pours a lot of $$ into the ideas (I'm a stay at home mom and don't work and he was making a great salary so he did what he felt would be best with the money). 

&amp;#x200B;

After the last (massive) failure last year that ate up a LOT of our money, I thought we were over get-rich ideas. His ideas are often quite good and he gets a lot of people really interested. He has had people give him $$ towards his ideas. But nothing ever works out.

&amp;#x200B;

He lost his job last fall and hasn't found a new one. Now, his latest idea is making PPE which is badly needed in our area. Sounds great. Except it's not. Long long story but his design and idea aren't working well. Now again my house has been converted into a workshop with materials EVERYWHERE. He's up all hours of the night working. Often waking me up at 2 am because he needs another set of hands.

&amp;#x200B;

This latest idea isn't working well and he's already put over $2,000 into it (and he's not working). I looked around my house this morning (sleep deprived because I was up for hours with him last night) and saw the utter mess and I think I want a divorce.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I in the wrong? Maybe I'm too sleep deprived to see things clearly? I *know* he's just trying hard to find a way to make money for us. But nothing ever works out and if he'd just have invested that money instead of spending it on ideas we would have over $100,000 now to invest.  He's doing it from a good place in his heart, but he won't stop (we've talked about it before). So am I wrong to break up our family over this?

"We've been together since early college, around 7 years. Married almost 1. Overall we're moderately successful. We both have careers and make good money. We rent a condo and are thinking about buying a house next year. We have good relationships with family and a few friends. But we struggle with a lot of things and I think it's mostly due to laziness.

We both have creative goals for ourselves and have a hard time working towards them. Birthdays are often a reminder of how much time we've wasted. We're both very out of shape but can't bring ourselves to exercise ever. We have a hard time keeping up with our respective friend groups on a regular basis and have lost connections as a result. Our condo is never really clean ever. We don't have sex often purely because it feels like a lot of work and watching TV just feels easier. It feels like we're just not living up to our potential in any way except with money. 

We always express unhappiness about the situation but have never really been able to solve it. We individually and together have tried things here and there to fix it. Once we ""ran"" a 5k together. Sometimes we set up ""dates"" where we try and work on our respective projects, but often we end up easily distracted. 

I don't know. My worry is that if I really want us to change, itll be up to me to drag him along. I could try working on things myself, but I don't feel supported in that. I'll try and engage my husband but he doesn't really think about things the same way I do. I kind of do most of the emotional labor (remembering these things, reminding him to do chores the rare times we do them). 

I don't know. How can we become real adults together? We would like to have a child in the next five years but it feels like we'd be horrid parents.

"So over a month ago, my wife (6 years married together 13 years in total) and i got into an argument and she decided to stay in the guest room, which either one of us does from time to time. After about 2 weeks, we spoke and decided that things were better. But we have both enjoyed having our own rooms and that both wanted to keep it like that. Personally i really enjoying having a room to myself, and some privacy. i was also pissed off that she was so quick to leave our bedroom and me, so i wasnt too keen or just letting her back in. Its kind of like we are dating again, we might meet up for dinner, or watch a movie together once in a while. We dont see each other every day, even though we are both in the house all the time. i have been working from home full-time for years, and shes regularly in and out of employment. Its starting to get strange for me, i feel like i need to see her less and less. i am also starting to feel like a bachelor again, it doesnt really feel like we in a relationship anymore. Our bedroom has now clearly become just my room, and she has her own room. We dont have any kids, and we dont really ever discuss our relationship with any family or friends so its not like anyones questioning it. For a while i had just put it covid, and it was just a way of dealing with being locked up in the same house. looking online i see that it can be normal for a couple to live in separate bedrooms and still be happy. I would love to hear any experiences anyone has had with this or even just their thoughts on our situation.  i seem to be lacking the ability to be see whether this is an each to their own type of situation, or if i am being played for a fool.

"**Hi guys.**

My ex boyfriend (27M) broke up with me (22F) 12 hours ago. Not re reading his messages and typing this is making me feel deeply hurt but I can’t keep doing that. I keep checking if he’s unblocked me but I know that he won’t. My heart is breaking and I can’t even cry (because I’m sleeping next to my mom). We were in a LDR for about 4 months and we talked for 3 months before getting together. I have loved him more than anything in my whole life. We met online and I’ve never even met him because we live in different countries but I believe that he was the best thing to have happened to me ( I am aware of how that might sound delusional ). I craved him so much and never got him. I miss him more than I can handle and it’s ripping my heart apart. He was suffering from depression and Had been admitted to a psych ward in the past. Every once in a while he used to come up to me feeling totally out of it and suicidal. I was there for him every time. We discussed that he should get therapy after the lockdown but I don’t know if he will go through with it anymore. Just yesterday we were talking about our future and careers. He dumped me coldly after a small disagreement about something. He has tried to break up with me around 4 times before and always ended up taking me back ( yes, a red signal I know). I wouldn’t pretend that we didn’t have our problems because we did. During the break up he told me he hadn’t loved me for a while. He seemed like a completely different person. He acted erratically and unpredictably and broke my heart into a million pieces in a very brutal. After typing all this it has become clear to me that I haven’t been respecting myself as much as I should have. I know it wasn’t a sustainable relationship and that I should just try to move on but at this point I don’t even need/want his love, I just want to be at least on talking terms. I want to be friends with him. I think, since we were together only for 4 months, a good friendship is a possibility. Not because I want him in my life in any form at all but because he’s a very smart and intelligent person. I would love to have him around. He was very possessive and I don’t have many friends and it just adds to the loneliness that I feel. A friend is all I need.

"I (18M) think my gf (17F) is abusive



Hey guys 
I want to start off by saying that she had been the one who was interested in me. She’s 17 and I’m 18 and we happened to be in the same class and had to do a project together. After hanging out for the project I offered her to stay longer and she wanted to. Long story short we started dating and are coupled for like 4 months now. 
But things seem to look a little fishy to me and I start to feel anxious and uncomfortable with the relationship.

Because she always tells me that I don’t listen to her. For example just yesterday we talked about her car for like 30 minutes on the phone. Then after a little pause I asked her if she wanted to start a new series with me on Netflix and she said that she’s not going to answer to that question before I answered. Then I asked what question she asked assuming I overheard it and she told me that I don’t listen to her and she doesn’t want to repeat herself ( this tends to happen very often ). Everything I say could lead to her being in a bad mood and thus causing me to feel guilt. 


She also has a toxic friend with whom she hangs out and talks with a lot. 
She doesn’t like me and tells my gf to break up with me and go cheat with her in a threesome. My gf declined that but she doesn’t really see why I’m bothered by the fact she got offered to cheat on me. Also yesterday there was this guy in her insta direct she told me (a guy she had sex with) I wasn’t bothered because it was a bug  but she also sent it to her friend and she said 
Maybe you should call him 

Like tf and my gf thinks it’s funny when in reality I just get hurt by it. After that she told me about all the guys she got hit on on instagram and sent me her dms and shit.  I told her confedentially „wow I can be really proud of myself that I got you without hitting on you“ and she just said nothing. 


She also has the urge to go party after corona is over. Or how she likes to say it: I want to go there and I miss it. It’s clubbing and she could go. But she also told me how many guys hit on her at the clubs and spend drinks for her and how guys try to dance with her. The fact that she told me she doesn’t want me to go with her makes me uncomfortable aswell. 

She told me she doesn’t want me to get jealous. I didn’t tell her she shouldnt go but she said: you won’t forbid me this. With the attitude of idgaf what you think. 

Everything is my fault and I always have to apologize. Also she stays at my house like 3 nights but then wants to stay home for a week. Like okay but I wanna spend time with you. When she comes over she always spends the night with me. She told me she needs her space and I respect that but after a week or so I want to see her again and she says I’m pushing her too much and she doesn’t feel comfortable when I ask when we see eachother again. It’s like we always spend time when she wants but not when I want. 

Another example me and a friend drive while she is in the back with her friend. All of a sudden her friend starts saying doesn’t a big dick hurt in your vagina, and my gf says I got a story to tell you. Then she whispers in her ear. And both laugh. I turn my head with a smile and she says turn around it’s not about you. 

We FaceTime every night and she is kind of disrespectful. She can be. She is out of FaceTime and after some time I say: come back to FaceTime I wanna see you, and she just reply’s „nah“ but when I’m doing that she says ok I can hang up then. Or when I say I want to hang up she says that i want to get lose of her. But when she wants to hang up it’s perfectly fine for me. 
I’d really appreciate some mental help guys she hasn’t been like this all the time. And i know she had troubled relationships before.

Edit:

May I also say that she talks about other guys a lot and says omg they’re so funny i like them a lot. And just yesterday she told they all drool when they see her and shit like that like cmon bro makes me uncomfortable. I don’t want to break up because I really like her like really from the bottom of my heart but she almost pulls off stuff like this on a daily.

TL;DR

Gf is always blaming on me and tells me about other guys maybe to hurt me.",relationships
"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 1.5 years. She is really kind, funny, loving, and I really care about her. The one place I feel is lacking in our relationship is our sex life. She never wants to have sex with me. We've only had sex once on our relationship and that was for our one year anniversary. It was great and I thought she'd want to start having it more since our first time together was out of the way.

I've tried to initiate sex with her on a number of occasions but every time she refused and says she doesn't want to. I don't pester her further after she refuses because I don't want her to do something she isn't comfortable with. I tried talking to her about this multiple times now but she always tells me she just wasn't in the mood at the time and doesn't go any further than that. She never tried to initiate sex with me.

At times my sexual frustration has lead to small fights between us over miniscule topics. I'm starting to think she may be asexual and just doesn't enjoy sex. When I brought this up to her, she got upset and it started another fight between us. The lack of communication on her end is starting to affect me negatively. I even asked if she wanted to try couples therapy, but she outright turned that down.

I would never cheat and I am personally against being in a open/polyamorous relationship. I don't want to bring another person in solely for sex and risk developing more feelings for them. But the lack of sex is straining on me and it makes think about whether I want a future with my girlfriend. I don't want this selfish thinking to be end of our relationship if there is a way to fix things. But I also wonder if this relationship should continue she doesn't seem to think there's a problem at all.

Tl;Dr: my girlfriend of 1.5 years never wants to have sex with me. She may be asexual but she won't address it or figure it out. The lack of sex/communication leads to fights between us. Would it be selfish of me to end things between us or should I continue to to try and find a solution?",relationships
"My bf (30m) and I (25f) have been together for 5 years. Things have been pretty good and I like him a lot, but recently i caught him lying and ever since I haven't been able to look at him the same way. 

6 months ago, I had to leave the country for a week due to a Visa situation. When I came back I felt something was off. I snooped and looked through his phone (I know this is horrible on me) and I found that he had been meeting up with his ex while I was away. He had been lying to me about it and telling me he was with a different friend.

I confronted him about it and he said it was just as friends. He was upset that I snooped but very apologetic and said he just wanted to catch up with her and didnt think I would be okay with it, so he didnt tell me. 

Up until this point, I had 100% trust in him. I never even considered that he would cheat. He is very straightforward and blunt, so if he was seeing someone else I figured he would just say it before ever cheating. Because of this, I believed in what he had said. 

He changed the password on his phone to make sure I wouldn't go through it again, which I understand. I was hurt, but decided to trust him and move on, so I let it go. 

Lately he has been on his phone a lot. Everytime I come in the room, he quickly switches screens or shuts it off. Today I asked if I could get some photos off his computer and he said no as he put a lock on it. 

I feel like something is off again. I made the decision to move on so I dont want to bring up an old argument but I cannot shake these feelings of distrust. What do I do?

Update: I confronted him about it this morning and he told me I'm being crazy. I asked to see his phone and he just kept saying no. Now hes gone to work. I dont trust him and I dont think I will. I dont know how to go from here...

Am I a jerk for wanting to tell him that he is enabling them when he is going to their rescue every time there is an issue?

As much as I love him and want to help, I feel like my knowledge on this is limited. I keep hinting at support groups, meditation, therapy, etc as outlets but he refuses and says that he feels fine just venting to me. In all honesty, it’s a lot to handle on my own.

"The title certainly outlines it pretty well, but I'm just at a major downpoint at the moment. 

Over the last month or so, I was chatting with a former co-worker (f/31) but she had called it off after telling me she was still interested in doing this, but she was still feeling for a previous relationship and didn't want to have us breakdown as a result. We hadn't had a proper date due to Covid so it wasn't the devastating blow a long-term relationship would be but still a bit of a defeat. 


More recently, another friend (f/30) recently popped back in my life and we have been hitting it off pretty well. Little flirty things here and there but nothing definitive at this point. Haven't heard from her today yet and it's really affecting me at the moment.

"TL;DR: *Hey, so I'm really puzzled. What is happening, and I'll try to make it as short as possible, is that the girl I'm dating, is considering going back to her ex.*  


**To clarify:** This is an online relationship, but we take it seriously. We call, have plans to meet up soon, and we're both adults that wish to have a future together.  


**So:** What happened essentially was, that the girl I'm dating borrowed her pc to her ex (They've known eachother for 5 years, dated for the first 2) because he had to do some js (JavaScript, which is a popular coding language) assignment that he couldn't do on his own pc. On the pc he discovered messages we, the girl and I, sent back and forth. From what she's told me, he got upset and hurried out, and blocked her on all media etc. She had a panic attack, from which I eventually managed to calm her down.  


He then, out of the blue, told her that he was coming over to her apartment, cause it was easier than calling or texting. She was scared, and I asked her if she was alone (Her mother was home) which she wasn't, and so I told her she would be safe. She agreed, and told me she would be in touch later, to which I replied I'd stay up till around 2 am if she needed me.  


I got a message on Snapchat at 2 am from her, explaining how sorry she was for all of this. She also explained to me, that she really didn't wanna lose her best friend. Which I totally understand.   


I told her that I understood, that I would be there for her etc. Until she brought up the fact that she would most likely either have to **get back with the guy** or **remain friends** in order to not lose him. I personally think that this is crazy. I've lost best friends before, even of the opposite gender, but I've never experienced anything like this. But then again, we're all different. Apparently this best friend of hers was also really jealous about her spending so much time on the chatting app we used, and so she began telling me things like ""You think he'll take me back (as a friend) if I delete the app?"" to which I replied that only she was to decide what she spent her time on.  


What really puzzled me wasn't that she was considering going back, because in some fucked up way I can see how this makes sense. But, it was that she began telling me that she didn't want to keep me from my own life etc. when we, that day actually, had a conversation about being serious about this and not wanting to sleep around, but save up (as the poor college students we are) and meet next summer. That was sort of when I realized she was actually considering this option, which really just messed me up.  


I stayed up till 4 am just trying to talk about memories with her and joking. We both actually had a good time considering the circumstances? But anyhow, fast forward 2 hours ago, she messaged me again. She had re-downloaded the chatting app after I had sent her a snapchat in the morning, because she wanted to say sorry, and because she missed me. I told her I had missed her too, and we talked for a bit before she went to bed. We told one another we loved eachother and cheesy stuff of the like, which sort of calmed me down about it all.  


Though she still hasn't made up her mind, I'm nervous and I'm weirded out. I've convinced myself that **whatever** decision she comes to, I have already found peace with. I know I'll be sad, heartbroken and devastated if she decides to go back to him, but I can understand in some fucked up way that it makes sense.  


What puzzles me, is that she's considering it, even though we've both expressed that we're really into one another, even going as far to say we love one another. I've tried suppressing my own feelings as to not complicate things for her, and I've done my best to not tell her ""You should do this"" etc. but just listened and given her help when she needed it.   


But then again, logically, the circumstances (those being, that this is online) of our relationship, make it worth considering and I suppose some would argue, that this guy is better for her.   


Again, I'm really sorry if this is not clear: What I want help with, is how to proceed. I'm currently just waiting for her to wake up so we can call and figure things out. But I have a life, I have papers to turn in, I have work to do. I've set healthy boundaries, as to the fact that I:  


1) will not be in a triangle-sort-of-drama relationship.  
2) will most likely not stay friends or let myself become a ""best friend"" if she decides to choose him.  


At this point, the only reason I'm staying is because I genuinely care and like her a lot, but this honestly feels like a betrayal to have someone tell you they like you, and that it's difficult for them to choose, but at the same time still choose. If I had to try and compare it to something, it feels like being punched in or swore directly to your face by your friend while they're under influence, but you stay cause you care for them.   


I know the - probably majority - of wise Redditors will tell me to move on, to forget about all of this and find a girlfriend in real life. And I understand, that is definitely the logical thing to do. But I've already had a fair share of girlfriends in real life, and I've come to realize that this feels different. Not as in ""Online is better"", but as in ""We have so much in common and we have so many plans"" that I've honestly never had with anyone else. We satisfy one another on an intellectual level, and we have the same kind of humor.  


I would hate for this to end, even though, at this point, it's most likely a 50/50 without the odds being in my favor.   


**To clarify:**  
I do not wish to break things off, I care for her and I want for us to keep going. But at the same time, I recognize the predicament she's in and the consequences it may have. I've found peace with that. But at the same time, **I need someone to tell me if what I'm doing, is the right thing.**   


If you've read this far, then I really appreciate it. Little to no sleep and worrying has got me messed up. I hope to find some clarification or listeners among the Redditors. In advance, thank you so much for your time.",relationships
"I love in Riverside, California. My landlord is a very conservative woman. She and her new husband have been traveling throughout the pandemic, but mostly in social distancing ways (like camping). But this is ridiculous. She clearly doesn't think this pandemic is a real problem. I have been renting a room here for over a year. 

People are hanging out right outside my room, using the kitchen, shared bathroom, and living room. 

So far what I've done to address the situation is say ""WHAT THE \*\*\*\*"" loudly when a group of people came in with monkey bread and without all wearing even fabric masks. I imagine that this is not the best civil response, but I am livid.

"TW: Addiction, drugs, self harm, eating disorders

Fair warning this might be long. A little backstory, my friend (we will refer to her as B) and I left our home country and are working abroad as aupair's (nanny's essentially) for the same family. We moved from the UK to Canada late last year. We share the same room and everything. We work for a single mom and look after her three kids, one is a baby. We came here wanting a fresh start, wanting to experience new things and become better people, and get out of the sad town we live in back home. Or at least that's what I thought. 

B has a history of substance abuse and mental health problems. She has been to treatment before, got psychiatric help, and the right meds (she has bipolar disorder). I have also had my struggles with severe depression/anxiety and substance issues. We came here because we were in a good place and wanted to start fresh and just have fun traveling. 

The past few weeks, B has been on a decline. Looking back on things her mental health hasn't been too good from the start and there were signs early on, but we all have our bad days and I know I have definitely had a few since we've been here. A few weeks ago she started talking to this guy on tinder, and eventually would go to his house on our days off to hangout with him. I found out after she had met with him a couple times that she bought $150 worth of valium from him. Anyway, I mentioned that it probably wasn't wise to spend that much money on DRUGS when she is already so stressed about money all the time, and told her I didn't approve. (side note she isn't fully sober, she does stuff here and there and usually she will try to hide it from me but I'd rather she be honest with me so I try not to be too harsh on her when she tells me that stuff) She didn't offer much of a response. We have weekends off and work mon-fri. She bought the valium on the weekend. On Sunday night she says she is going to this guy's house. I told her that's not a good idea since it's very late and we work very early and I'm not going to cover for her or do her portion of the work if she's tired the next day. She promises me that she won't and everything will be okay. She shows up the next morning and I can immediately tell she is high. She says it was just weed, I guess i'll never know for sure but I really didn't care what she was high on because we were supposed to be taking care of these kids and it was super inappropriate to show up high. I would like to note that I am not one of those anti-weed people, but keep in mind that we have an infant to look after and also she is the type of person who you can tell when they are high so I was nervous about our host mum noticing. Then just as expected she asked if I could watch the kids while she slept because she was so tired. 

The entire rest of the week I had to do 80-90% of the work because each day B was either too depressed or anxious to function. She mostly slept all day while i took care of the kids. On multiple days I noticed her slurring her words, so I asked if she was high. She told me no to my face and said she only took the meds prescribed to her. I made her swear to it and she did, but seeing as I am with her all day everyday I knew in my gut she was lying. She was slurring her words so bad I could barely stand to hear it, and she looked high as well. I decided to tough it out since she was clearly struggling to cope with some mental stuff and wait to have a talk about it all. Also forgot to mention that I saw her cutting herself with her fingernails while we were sitting on the couch with one of the kids in the room, and she brushed it off as a nervous tick. She also has an eating disorder and has been skipping meals to the point where my host mum asked her about it and then asked me if she needs to worry about her.

When we first came to the country, B made a comment about some oxy's that were in the cabinet. The entire box was full, maybe 20 in there. I have been keeping my eye on them since made that comment and saw the other day that the box was gone. Tonight I confronted her about everything, and I told her that she is being unfair not just to me but to our host family. Told her I am getting really exhausted picking up her slack and that I love her but this is not okay and I hate seeing her in so much pain but shit needs to change and she needs to get help. I know it might be hard right now to seek therapy with the virus and everything but i said i would look at all of her options with her. I also confronted her about the oxy, which she denied several times before finally coming clean and then just broke down. It just really hurt me that she lied to my face several times when I asked her straight up. She told me she needs time to figure things out and that I ""cant cross the boundary"" of telling her mum, to which I responded that she shouldn't have crossed my boundaries and put my job, home, and these kids at risk. She already crossed SEVERAL boundaries and now I have the stress of her job and mine and trying to figure out how to help her. She says that going home isn't an option, but I think maybe taking a step backward might be necessary to take a step forward in her case. 

She told me last week that she flushed the rest of the valium but that was another lie. When I asked her tonight if she had anymore she lied again and I looked and found it and flushed it. Told her we have to tell her mum eventually but she is insisting that we don't say anything about the drugs. I don't know how to navigate this situation. I don't want her to go home but I really need her mum's help and I want B to get the help she deserves as she is clearly hurting deeply and not coping. Should I wait to talk to B more about possible solutions or just ring her mum straight away? Also side note mostly everything I mentioned happened in the span of 2-3 weeks. Sorry this was so long:-/ Feel free to give any advice, especially if you have experience in dealing with addiction, eating disorders, or mental health in general.

TL;DR My friend and I nanny together in a foreign country and she has been spiraling for the past couple weeks, stealing drugs from our host family, and being high around the children.",relationships
"

I’m 30s F and he’s 40m we have been together 4 years and don’t live together etc

Hi 

As per my title , I’m feeling annoyed and fed up with SO. As per lockdown we haven’t seen each other for 7 weeks or so now. At first all was well, we were texting, phoning each other, fb messenger etc.

Then when I was phoning his mother was phoning so he had to go answer. She rings him all damn day anyway. If not that, soon as I get on the phone, he needs to pee or he’s gonna nap, always something as for why he can’t just sit still and natter to me. 

So I didn’t bother ringing him. The same started happening over text, soon as I get in a conversations, he’s napping, peeing, going to bed etc

He has been ill on n off a few weeks so I could forgive a bit but this was before all that. He got taken to hospital Sunday night. Obviously with the virus I couldn’t be there neither could his mum. I stayed up all night texting him, I knew if I didn’t I wouldn’t hear my phone I’m a hearing aid user. Hes a wheelchair user so with the hospital I was super worried. No mention or thanks for me staying up all night or anything 

He came home the next day. I tried to ask about it and tried to ring him but he said not to ring. I think maybe his mother is staying there, but like why not just say that instead of being weird and distant with me? 

Even this morning he messaged me so I messaged back. No sooner did I get 2 messages sent, I got the going for a nap one. I wouldn’t mind but this was happening before he was ill as well. 

I just left him to it yesterday and when he asked why I was quiet I said I didn’t want to bother him. So I left it at that, then he messages on fb messenger not for long as he was going to bed of course. His son yelled at him not too long ago about this same crap. The poor kid kept trying to
 contact him and talk to him but he kept saying he was doing this or that and not ringing the kid back from what I understand.

Am I doing something wrong? Like I’m really stressing myself and I have anxiety and skin stuff going on myself never mind all this. I feel I can’t talk to him as he always has a problem if that makes sense? There’s always something but I’m not allowed an opinion as of course mummy knows best. 

I just feel really annoyed and fed up with him . Like I know we in lockdown but I feel a bit out of sight out of mind with him . I did mention about all this once a couple weeks back , he said ok, then went straight back to it!

Sorry it sounds so whiny I feel really down with my skin stuff really bothering me and he isn’t helping :/

Since being in the hospital, he’s been really weird with me and I have no idea what’s going on with him . I keep asking why he was in why he’s on meds. He will not tell me anything. I find this really odd and alarming as why is it a secret? What’s he hiding ? 

I’m not allowed to ring him I’m hardly allowed to ask what’s wrong with him. He just keeps saying he doesn’t know. I feel like he does know and doesn’t want to tell me, for whatever reason . If I ask him anything about it he gets angry with me. Even accused me of fishing for info. Like I was some random nosey person not gf of 4 years. If I don’t ask or don’t bother him I’m ignoring him . 

I just don’t know what to do at all. I feel hurt that he is keeping something from me, I don’t do well with this sort of stuff. He knows I have anxiety and worry a lot. My mind has gone to worse case scenario like what if he’s cheated and caught something and that’s what all the secrecy’s about ? I’m going there as I honestly have no idea what’s wrong with him .

Sorry for rambling on or if I’ve repeated anything , my head is all over the place :/

TL;DR , bf being really weird after being in hospital, won’t tell me anything at all, really upset and unsure what to do :/",relationships
"For a bit of background, my ex and I broke up about 3 months ago. It was amicable and we agreed we wanted to stay friends. The reason we broke up is because my ex hated his job (it really was bad - I watched it slowly destroy him) and had been offered a good new job in a different city. He wasn’t keen on the idea of long distance and said that, due to the circumstances, he didn’t feel confident in committing to a future with me right now.

He sold most of his possessions and moved away a couple of weeks later. At that point, we went into no-contact for about 6 weeks.

Then a week ago, he reached out to me again asking how I was, how I was finding the COVID lockdown, etc. We had a friendly conversation and it transpired that he has lost his new job due to the lockdown, and will be moving back to our city at the end of this month to take his old job back. 

He has got a new apartment sorted, but it has no furniture. I have a spare bed and set of drawers I have been looking to get rid of, and it crossed my mind today that maybe I should offer them to him? Or would this be a weird offer to make an ex?

Tl;dr: ex boyfriend is moving back to our city after losing his new job. His new apartment has no furniture and I thought I could offer him my spare bed and set of drawers I am looking to get rid of. Would this be a weird offer to make or should I just go for it?",relationships
"I've seen this guy about a handful of times, I think we're somewhat dating/seeing each other. Throughout COVID, I often go to his in the afternoon/evening - usually a pretty chill day, he cooks or I do and we go for walks. He has a pretty small apartment, so he cooks in the kitchen not facing me while I'm sitting on the couch (occasionally bored out of my brains because he's hardly talking to me) and doesn't put the tv on for me or anything, and then we just sit on the couch and quietly eat together. He has a particular type of humour he says that rubs me the wrong way. A while back I was talking about something and I said to him I won't bore him to death, he said ""Bore me to death anytime, hopefully with some of your body but words will do as well"" I found it a bit sexist and weird. Okay, so, he's also a bit more religious and traditional than I am. That's fine but I think its starting to rear its ugly head. 

I remember the first time we had sex, we were in a doggy position and I just asked him if we could start with him on top as it feels more comfortable for some reason. He looked all sad and immature and said ""can we just start from the back sweetie?"" which I found very odd, I've slept around enough and have never encountered this. Most men are happy to have sex regardless. I started to ask him a few questions sexually and he told me I was being vulgar and way too sexually forward and almost made me feel guilty about it. Strange, as to how can you know what someone does and doesn't like if you don't express it? 

Saw him the other night, he told me I have a vocal fry voice at some point. He just often jokes around that I don't behave or something weird. Told me I was being bossy when I just caringly enquired about the tea that he just made and to make sure it doesn't go cold. When he said that, I had no clue as to how I was being bossy and asked ""Oh when?"" he didn't answer and I had to ask a few more times. We had sex that night and he wouldn't allow me to touch his genitals as he cums a bit fast, absolutely fine with me. He just got me to stand up for a good 10 minutes, playing and kissing with my behind and I was like, can I lay down with you? He jokingly said I was being lazy and how hard it was for me to just stand up. Sorry for the TMI - he got me on my knees, holding my head and every time I did that, my head would subconsciously go back especially as I was below him and looking up and he said to not move, I couldn't not move my head. He always gets me to suck on the things below but not the actual genitals as it makes him ejaculate quickly. I was doing that and then for the first time he was literally rubbing his genitals up and down to my eye area and I was like ""Wow what're you doing? that's my eye"" He went in from behind and I was just moving a bit as anyone does in the horizontal mambo and he was like ""don't move"" ""Sweetie, when I tell you to not move, don't"" again, in a jokingly manner. Then told me after the sex, I'm only sometimes good and clearly stubborn. I was thinking, this is sex, I'm not a robot. It's supposed to be two people 'making love'. Again, very strange to me. 

He went to use my phone as we were laying together regarding some video and he saw one of my searches which was porn and I quickly said ""Oops, bit of porn"" and he was like ""Do you really watch porn?"" He was also pretty insolent when we were watching a YouTube video together, laughing about something and commented on how cute some lady was that went through a tummy tuck was - to me, there is no time for saying comments like that. Strangely, out of everything, he's very complimentary about my looks (face and body). 

I find him quite condescending to me as well. For example, comparing his drip coffee to the machine I have at home, he will be like ""well how does it exactly grind the beans?"" I find emotionally connecting with him also quite difficult, I feel he doesn't want to reveal information at times. I've dated guys before where it just feels so natural, intimate and you can speak on the phone for hours for example. These guys have been my age, a bit older, or even older than this guy. However, this current guy I've seen a handful of times barely asks intimate details or wants to reveal anything.

Examples:

I asked about his past relationships, he just said they ended and didn't go into further detail. I briefly talked about my ex-partners and he didn't ask why it ended. He asks very vague questions about my University degree. He was showing me photos him and his friends of 5-10 years ago and then showed me a few girls and was like ""She was cute, she's fat now"" or ""She was lots of fun"" and never thought about asking to see photos of me when I was younger or whatever. I do not intend to sound cocky but I've lived a somewhat interesting life, I've lived in 4 continents, I can snowboard and surf on a longboard. I ain't that boring. He also once snubbed off my approach of bringing up a philosophical question and once texted me saying something quite smart ass about it. I, on the other hand, is very engaged and I ask a billion questions and show interest/care. 

When I left his house in the morning after we went for a walk, I was telling him to have a good day and genuinely asking about what he had to get up to, it seemed he brushed over the question to me but wasn't that interested. He texted me that night saying he was some type of food and I sent him a photo of mine, we talked for a bit (again, no questions about the rest of my day) and he said he was sleepy so I've left it. That was last night, nothing so far. He normally follows up if I don't reply so maybe he's thinking I'm second-guessing things. 

**tl;dr**: guy I'm seeing is starting to become a bit insulting to me. We are also having problems sexually where I feel my needs are not met but it appears he won't allow me to voice them without being told I am being vulgar. I feel it's either due to his somewhat religious/traditional background.",relationships
"&gt;TL;DR: 3-year relationship is stagnant, OP is not physically attracted to and has grown disappointed with immature boyfriend, deep down wants to separate but does not want to destroy him, feels trapped

We met at work and have been dating for about three years. Funnily enough, despite repeated warnings that dating a coworker would end in disaster, our relationship has outlasted the job itself as we've both since found better employment elsewhere.   
  
But it's far from a romance for the ages. It's a comfortable, fairly passionless, *settled*-feeling relationship and that scares me. He is a very kind man and I enjoy his company, but I believe it's on a level more akin to a very good friend than a lover. And I have been in love before, so I have a definite metric for comparison. 
  
My boyfriend isn't in any way dangerous, but there's so much about him I don't like that I have had more than enough time to realize will not change. Don't get me wrong- I am *not* one of those ""I can fix him!"" types. I hate that sentiment. But he's offered up of his own volition the willingness to change and better himself all on his own (he claims to not really like himself or the way he is), and yet...doesn't. He has *extremely* bad procrastination problems, terrible time management, is messy, not terribly creative, and gets bored easily. He also seems to have grown up *shockingly* bereft of certain basic life skills. He can't cook (I mean, I had to show him how to *make spaghetti*), he can't clean, and he would rather just throw things away than try to fix or clean them.  
   
I also realized that I am just not physically attracted to him. He's far from what anyone would call ugly, but he's also a gentleman on the larger side and I entered the relationship with an open mind, not thinking it would be an issue, but...it just is. I guess I *do* have a type and he's not it. But there again is an area he himself has said many times *he* would like to change (he didn't used to be as big as he is), and just...doesn't.   
  
I'm fairly in shape myself and have gone out of my way to show him healthy eating and exercise habits upon request that he at first always seems gung-ho about, but never actually adopts. Yet he'll still pat his stomach and talk about getting ""back down to [his] playing weight"" quite often. When dining out, he'll always opt for the most bacon-wrapped, cheese-blasted double-portioned option of anything on the menu with a large coke or sweet tea (sidenote: when I long ago suggested drinking tea as a healthy alternative to sodas, he took that to mean *sweet tea*, genuinely not seeing the issue with it in regards to health). Even sex is unpleasant and we barely have it anymore.  
  
It's a combination of incompatible physicality and his near-complete lack of conviction when it comes to acting on the things he constantly says he'll do. I find the latter so off-putting. I have aired the above grievances to him (among a few others) during some healthy and civil discussions about our relationship, but he just kind of dismissed it all and/or had an excuse for everything. Also quite off-putting.  
  
But the thing is, I know I am the love of his life, his dream woman, his (perceived) soul mate. He's told me as much. I've sat down and tried to imagine marrying him, having children with him, spending the rest of my days with him, and the thought does not sit well with me at present. I don't want to be his mother, I don't want to be his maid, but I also don't want to break his heart.  There is someone else [30M] in my life who I feel I would be *way* more compatible with, but cannot and will not act on it as long as I am in my current relationship. I don't know what to do. Please help me.",relationships
"My girlfriend is angry and upset that I wont come and see her. I said no 5 weeks ago, 1 week into lockdown, on grounds that its not safe. Now shes gone back to work, but has 2 weeks booked off coming up in which I was meant to see her. When I mentioned I obviously still couldn't come she started yelling and saying I'm lazy and just dont want to see her because I don't care, which is obviously hurtful, and that I never make any effort.

She then went to bed and I sent her a message to build bridges, which she accepted this morning. She then asked again if I would come and see her, which I explained no it's still not safe (2 people in my household interacting with the public, same in hers). She then hung up on me.

I messaged saying how much I love her and she replied saying shes struggling not to breakdown dealing with so much stress and not seeing me and she just wants me there. I said I totally understood and I was sorry I hadnt been more thoughtful, to which she snapped back ""still not going to come down though are you"". I haven't opened it.

I don't know what to do. She knows it's not safe for me to come see her, she knows it would cause a huge argument for me with my family and for her when I showed up at hers, but she won't see reason and now I'm genuinely worried about her and don't know what to do? Am I missing something? Should I say fuck the law and go? Some of my friends think shes being manipulative but I hope she'd never guilt me into something like this.

I've been wracked with anxiety and guilt all day because if I go I'd be essentially running away from home and starting a huge fight to do something thsy is morally wrong anyway, but if I don't then she continues to think I don't care and I can't cheer her up, I just want her to be happy.

"Reposting with details at the top so they don’t get missed. 

Relationship details: 
Time length: 1 year, 
Age/gender of ex: Male, late 20s, 
My age/gender: Female, late 20s

Long version (TL;DR at bottom): Put a lot of effort into a year long relationship, opened up about past hurts/betrayals and other experiences. 

My ex was very kind at first, we had that relationship where we could talk about literally anything and just enjoy that and learning from each other. 

There was a breach of trust (not cheating), and we decided to stay together and work through it. Come to find out he’d reached out to an ex behind my back, literally when I was sleeping right next to him. 

I had a lot going on in that year, sudden family death, a friend’s betrayal, and other serious things going on with a relative (can’t detail for ongoing legal reasons). 

I found out my ex was still on dating apps. When I shared a little more detail about my past hurt, they immediately reacted with assuming I was lying instead of going to any hint of compassion. I ended things that same day. 

We broke up last May, but during the relationship I had noticed this one girl on a social media of his that I had a bad feeling about. I never brought it up because I figured it really could just be a friend of his sister’s or family friend/relative (this was the case for most girls on sm), and I didn’t want to add to strain we already had going on without explicitly clear and obvious reasons. 

He’d told me once, that the next girl he’d date wouldn’t still be in college (weren’t arguing at the time, just a talk. One of many red flags towards the end). 

Low and behold, this girl I’d had the bad feeling about isn’t in college and they became a couple. 

I took a few months to really consider my thoughts and feelings, get advice and opinions, and pray on it. I decided that I couldn’t stay silent if there was a chance someone else might get hurt by him, so I reached out to her. It was a civil exchange, and while I knew there was a chance she might have known she was the other girl, I thought the chance that wasn’t the case outweighed the risk. 

It turned out she was aware, and tried to lie to me saying they only knew about each other/started talking months after he and I had broke up. Now I know this isn’t true, because they live over 250 miles apart, so something happened to make them friends on social media while my ex and I were still together. 

I haven’t and will not be contacting either of them since. I know I deserve better, but lately with this betrayal and that of a friend (and everything else that happened in that tough year), I’ve been considering if maybe I just want to stay alone for life. 

I know that may sound ridiculous and extreme, but hear me out: I can just work and do what I enjoy, have a few close friends, and don’t let myself care too much about the rest. I don’t really want to give up, but I’m at the point of seriously doubting that there’s anyone out there willing to accept someone with a history that’s already come a long way in working through that and seen success in many other areas of life. I thought I had found that, only for it to have been a big lie. 


TL;DR: 
Found out after the break up that my ex had been cheating. Reached out to new girl in case she wasn’t aware - she tried to lie about it. 

Was it wrong for me to reach out to her? Is there a different way I should have approached the situation?",relationships
" I love my partner but he is overweight and struggles really hard to eat regularly, and often binges on pasta, pizza, cookies, and crackers. I make sure I always have fruit and vegetables in the house, I cook him a lot of healthy meals, but he often says he is not hungry but then gorges later, before bed. He says he feels sick when he eats breakfast and he says is too busy at work to eat. He is aware that I wish he was a slimmer and healthier, and he often comments on how good I look (I'm quite fit). This has been a struggle for me for almost 3 years. I've tried everything from attempting to guide his every meal to not talking to him about food at all for months.

"We're both unemployed right now and having some money problems. However, today I was really craving some chocolate, and I have the ingredients to make cake or cookies or w/e, but not the energy to do it, so I asked if we could order something. He said no, it's a bad idea, we need to cut back, etc. Now, while I know he's right, the reason I'm upset is last month he asked me for the exact same thing. And I agreed, because my thought process was, we really shouldn't, but let's be happy now and figure out the money later.

And the thing is, this is a pattern. He used to ask me to do lots of stuff all the time, like chores, or getting something across the house for him, etc, and he just expected me to say no if I didn't want to. He's dialed it back by a lot since the last conversation we had about it, when I explained that I just don't like saying no to him and I prefer he only asks for what he really needs, and I do what he asks about 90% of the times. Meanwhile, he'll often say no to really simple things I ask, like when I had my cat on my lap today and asked him to bring me a plate of food from the kitchen while he was getting his. I often catch myself thinking, when I'm doing a favor for him, that if I asked him for the same thing he would have said no.

He wants me to be the responsible one and say no to him when he falters and wants to spend money we shouldn't, but I just want to make him happy in those situations cause it's clear he needs it. And I expect him to have the same care with me and reassure me that we'll figure it all out later, cause I already know we can't afford it, but if I'm asking it's because I really need it. He says he gave his opinion and won't be upset if I order anyway. But I just want him to support me like I support him, even if I'm doing something stupid. So the reason I'm posting is I'm not sure how to compromise on this. Am I being irrational?

"My [F,22] LDR bf [M,28] earns some nice cash. At the beginning he would tell me I wouldnt spend a cent on meetings because I’m a broke university student living off of low scholarships and the money my father gives me. I insisted on paying my ticket, and when I told him I wouldnt be able to do half half on accommodation cause the one he picked was too expensive, he went crazy. After that he agreed to pay, and I was very uncomfortable about it. I paid for our museum tickets and some meals to make it up to him (it wasnt anything expensive to him, he got a cheaper accommodation). 

Next time, I again bought myself the ticket and told him I wanted to get him more gifts, but I wouldnt be able to do half half then, maybe less. For him, the whole price of that equals to the most trivial thing he would pay in the country he lives, like going shopping for basic groceries would be much more expensive. For me on the other hand, it’s a huge amount of money, and almost half my mother’s paycheck. He got angry, and I skipped meals and ate the cheapest stuff to give him 50€ and to buy him gifts also, and prepare myself. He took it like its nothing. Then he got himself a 30€ steak when we dined together, and I paid my meal. I was so hurt, cause that money is nothing to him, while to me its huge.

It was also my birthday, he bought me the cheapest add ons for my bracelet he got me (he did buy the cutest gifts the first time), but spent double the amount for toys for his nieces, then they didnt like it, cried, and he bought then again even more expensive stuff. 

I got mad when he wouldnt do anything on Valentines day, so he sent me flowers, and then complained how expensive they were (Im sure they were nowhere near the money he would pay in his country). And always push it on me when we would argue how he got me this and this, took me to see nice places....

Also one very important thing. During corona, both of my parents lost their jobs. I took it upon myself to start working online giving classes at least. Then I got sick with corona, and worked with the worst fever. It was so difficult to talk to people, and feel like I dont have enough air. Also I study medicine (for a doctor) and had to study at the same time. He never once offered to help me out, even though we’re together for over a year. I wouldnt accept it anyways, but it would be nice if he asked me.

In my country, guys pay for everything, and although Im against that, Im a student and he has an extremely good income


Tl;dr My bf has an extremely good paycheck, while he expects me, a broke student, to pay half half. He got nice gifts in the beginning, and was more generous, but is less and less with time.

a few weeks after returning home, my partner revealed to me that the episode i had severely damaged him, as he dealt with a schizophrenic mother and some of my irrational fears and behaviors when i was having my episode brought up that trauma in him. it was probably very scary and stressful for him seeing me panic for my life and constantly think i was going to die. i sensed something was off ever since i returned home. he didn't want to talk to me as much. something was off. he recently revealed to me that he wants to ""take a break"" for a few weeks so we can focus on ourselves and because he was so hurt by what he went through with me and i have a suspicion i'm going to get dumped soon because he said he wanted to evaluate whether he wanted to stay in the relationship.

i'm so ashamed of everything that happened. i wish i didn't have this disorder. i wish i never had my episode. my partner is everything to me and i feel horrible. i wish i could've just kept it together. 

tldr, ocd lead to mental breakdown. i had to move back home. boyfriend traumatized by mental breakdown. boyfriend wants break. i feel horrible and ashamed about the entire situation.",relationships
"So I've been seeing this girl for about 6 months now. I had just come out of a long term relationship and started seeing this new girl fairly soon after. It was great - she is smart, funny, gorgeous and tonnes of fun to be around.

I moved into my new place and she more or less moved in straight away. It was perfect, no arguments, just fun and exciting. It felt like we had known each other for years. However, I had some ED problems in the past that came up again (or not) with her. However, she was really supportive about it but it 's still embarassing to deal with. My previous relationship was pretty sexless, but the new girl had a really high sex drive, so it was difficult to get used to and I wasn't sure how often to initiate it without coming across as clingy, and also I missed some of the social cues. About 2 months in, after a night where we both got into bed tired I just said night and kissed her and went to sleep. She woke me up and said that she felt like she always initiated sex, and that it had been 48 hours since we last had sex. I didn't comlpetely think that this was the case, but apologised and said that I would initiate it more from now on. Fast forward, and she has recently gone back to her parents house to isolate for COVID. Since then, she has been kind of distant and I've been the one who has made all the effort and lead the conversation.

Anyway, today I told her that I'd read something about some prescription medication that I'm on potentially contributing towards my ED. She replied saying that it was 'interesting', but that it still took her pushing me to go and see the doctor and to try and resolve the situation. We carried on talking and she told me that she is still frustrated and annoyed about her having to initiate sex, and said that after that she thought that I was forcing it and that it was 'fake', and thinks that from now on she might always think that. I've tried to assure her that this isn't the case, but she thinks that in the relationship she's been dictatorial and I've just done whatever she says. I've tried to argue that with most things in relationships if one person feels that something isn't right and tells the other person, and the other person alters their behaviour to suit, that isn't being fake or dictatorial but just trying to work to suit each other and be the best for each other. She said that she still can't believe that she had to initiate sex more than me and that she had to have a conversation with me about it. I tried to call her about it this evening, but she said she was watching a movie and was going to get an early night because she has a big day at work tomorrow. However, we have agreed to call tomorrow.

My question is, what on earth to I say on this call tomorrow? i want to let her know that it's not fake and that I just didn't realise that she had a much higher sex drive than me and that I just found it emabrassing becasue of my ED issues, but I've been making much more of an effort for her and don't want her to throw away what we've got (because everything else aside from the sex is so perfect) just because she thinks I'm being fake or that our whole relationship is fake. I just want her to know that I really do think the world of her and don't want her to think that every time i would initate sex when she comes back to our city is 'fake' or forced and that I don't want to do it. Thank you in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I have ED sometimes, girl i'm seeing told me that she wanted me to initiate sex more, now that I do she calls it fake and thinks I only did it because she told me to. How do I convince her that this isn't the case?",relationships
"Hi everyone,

Thanks in advance for your help. I have been together with my girlfriend for a little more than a year. Since the very beginning she has been very honest about her past drug use. In her twenties she liked to party pretty hard and used everything from XTC to Speed and Cocaine. She has had periods in her life where she would use drugs weekly at parties. She has absolutely no problems with recreational druguse and had a long relationship with a different person who was also fine with that. I did not know her at that time. Since I know her she has used XTC once. She's pretty much grown out of it on her own.

When I was younger I knew a lot of people who were in to drugs, but it just was'nt for me. I did smoke a lot of weed when I was a teenager, but I gave that up at about 18. I like to drink alcohol at parties though. I tried XTC twice in my twenties and didnt feel good about myself after. I started working at 18 and tried to take life seriously at that point.

The problem is: I cant stop thinking about her drug use. I know it's in the past, but I keep getting a mental image of her doing it and my stomach flips over. I am serious about this relationship and I try to keep my worries to myself. I just cant shake the bad feeling. I feel guilty about having these thoughts while we are otherwise having a great day. Sometimes it's all I can think about all day.

I have told her that I have difficulty accepting her past drug use, but I try to keep it to myself for the most part. I am not worried about future drug use. I just can't shake the past. It's not rational. I feel that if I break up with her because of this, then I will be missing out on a great girlfriend.

Has anyone gone through this before? Can anybody give me any advice on how to deal with these feelings? I don't want to give up on this relationship.

TL;DR: I have recurring thoughts and mental images of my girlfriends past partydrug use. I am having trouble accepting her past. I know future drug use is no issue and it's all in my mind. Has anyone got tips on how to deal with this?",relationships
"I just need a place to vent. I feel like I can't talk to my parents or friends about this because I'm just so embarrassed and just don't want them to know about this. My boyfriend's screaming/yelling has been a prominent issue over the past year. The culprit of his screaming is from stress and frustration. He has a high stress-inducing, sales job based on commission, so I understand his frustration and could never do his job. He has never screamed directly at me but has done it in the same room as me and it always sets me over the edge and not want to be around him.

So last night, he missed a big sale and told me he was upset about it. I always tell him to not focus so closely on his sales numbers because of how much they fluctuate and said he'd probably get a better sale soon -- he did, 10 mins later, but then another customer canceled an order and he screams at the computer. He cooled down for about a half-hour and then petted our dog but she swatted him in the face and knocked his glasses off. Meanwhile, I'm in the kitchen cooking our dinner. He freaked out, screamed, and ran upstairs. I continued cooking because I'm just so used to this at this point that I just ignore it. He comes back down and screams about how she scratched up his glasses and it's going to cost him so much money which he doesn't have because he keeps losing sales. This lasted about 10 minutes. He then cools down and tells me his glasses aren't even scratched to which I ask, ""Then why were you so upset?!?"" Then he grabs a taco shell and it breaks, which sets him off into even more rage. He then tells me to enjoy a pound of tacos because he isn't even going to eat. I then tell him, ""I'm just going to eat upstairs because I can't be around you."" Me and the dog go upstairs and I just slam the door out of frustration because this is ridiculous and nothing I say is going to stop him.

About 20 mins later, our doorbell rings. Mind you this is 9 PM. I knew exactly who it was even though this has never happened to us before. Three cops showed up to our door and I overheard them telling my boyfriend that they got a call about a disturbance and that someone was yelling and throwing things. My bf blamed the dog and said he screamed because she hit him in the face. The police then asked if anyone else was home and asked if they could see me to make sure I was ok. I have horrible anxiety and cops just intimidate me so I did not want to do this but I had to. I walked up to the door smiled, waved, said hello, and told them everything was fine and then they went on their way.

I'm just so humiliated and upset with my boyfriend but I am glad this happened because he needed to know how much of a problem this is. His behavior is so unacceptable and I told him this was likely not the first time the neighbors heard him act this way. My boyfriend did say however that he was embarrassed and never wanted this to happen again so he told me he is never going to scream and even said he would seek therapy, which I have encouraged ever since the screaming started.  I’m so afraid that he will rub off on me and make me a bitter person who screams too, even though I never do.

**UPDATE: Last night, he changed his story and said he is not at all embarrassed about the police showing up and that he does not care what anyone thinks about him. He also told me his mental health is none of my business and that what he says to his therapist will be between him and his therapist. He also does not understand where my concerns and anger towards him ""came from all of a sudden"" when the screaming has been ongoing, I have asked him repeatedly to stop, and I have gotten upset with him for not stopping the little things that annoy me when I ask him to. I said it is a breaking point.**

**I feel stuck because I currently feel very stuck in the situation I am in. Yes, my boyfriend has anger issues and doesn’t respect my boundaries, but he does go to work most of the day now and I get the place completely to myself. We also share a dog who favors me over him and I am very attached to her. If we broke up, he would keep her because he pays all the vet bills and has legal ownership over her. It makes me sad to think I might never see her again.**

**With my parents, they fight too and will get annoyed with me at the smallest thing. My dad is really hard to be around and possibly a tier below my boyfriend's anger level. He has zero patience and lashes out so easily for no reason. I’m so happy to be away from my dad, but I am not happy here.**

**My plan right now is to stay with my parents for a few weeks and see how things go from there. I don't feel like I have the best options but also can't afford anything else right now.**

**TL;DR: Idk what I'm looking for but I wish I could talk to someone. I made a previous post about issues we were having and we actually had a really good talk and found a balance that works for us. I hate that this happened and just don't know what to do. I love him and I don't want to leave, but sometimes I also don't want to be around him. What more can I do to help him?**",relationships
"Please don't post this elsewhere, I've changed some details about this situation in case anyone recognizes it but I still don't want to take chances.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a very isolated person and don't really have any close relationships. This is in part due to trust issues from my last relationship. I have never been the romantic type and am jaded to relationships and marriage, but this guy really made me believe. But I realized that he wasn't coming through and I was turning into a second mother to him, and eventually had to drop him about a year and a half ago. It was the hardest choice I ever made, but it was the right one. I'm still just emotionally crippled and have a lot of trust issues because of it. I also don't really have anyone now that I feel particularly close to.

&amp;#x200B;

That's where the FWB comes in. He's a friend of my ex who I've been friendly enough with for many years, and we've had some shared personal drama we were able to support each other through. Nothing crazy. I've also always known him as a bit of a womanizer and he's very open about the fact he doesn't do relationships due to his own trust issues. After a few months of us just chatting, he very clearly showed some interest. I rebuffed the idea at first, thinking that I couldn't do that to my ex even if I didn't really like him as a person anymore. But when it came out that my ex actually did the same thing to me several months prior, I had a bit of a change of heart. Why was I STILL denying myself things for the sake of this dude? I decided ""fuck it"" and began a bit of a flirtationship with my soon-to-be FWB and it's been a lot of fun. I don't have much sexual experience outside of my ex and I had already wanted to put myself out there and explore a bit. This seemed like a more than perfect opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Aaaaand then FWB starts actually being very sweet to me. He's always talked about himself like he's very cold and distant, and can't handle emotional intimacy, but that never was the case when we talked. We don't talk constantly or anything, but when we do, I've been taken aback by how easily he opened up and seemed to want to talk about personal things. I've always really enjoyed his company, but there has always been that emotional threshold I didn't cross of being too attached based on everything he told me about himself. I didn't have any difficulty or issue with that, until he started doing things like remembering one off things I said, like how I don't get hugs very often and I secretly like them. After hearing that, every time we say bye with a hug and I try to pull away quickly because I assume I'm supposed to, he offers a better hug, cause he knows that's what I actually want. The first time that happened, I almost cut off our FWB situation cause I could feel how deeply that one, tiny act of kindness affected me. It's the nicest thing anyone has done for me that I can remember. Just remembering something about me. I know that's a very low bar, but it's where I'm at.

&amp;#x200B;

He also calls me from time to time when particularly emotionally difficult situations come up and we talk it out. He's offered to do the same for me if I need it, but I can't imagine asking anything of anyone still. I feel like it's too much to ask to have someone be there for me. And if it isn't, then I might cross over that attachment barrier too much to go back. Because of how much he made it clear that he is scared of relationships and attachment, even platonic, I'm afraid to even value just our friendship as highly as it feels like he does. He's said before he's so afraid of attachment that he removes himself once he feels it starting, but the way he acts towards me I can't help but feel that attachment to some degree is impossible not to have.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is a mess by now and I apologize for not being able to put my thoughts and feelings out in a way that makes more sense and also gets all the information across. I just don't know how bad of an idea this is, I guess? Like I said, I don't have a lot of experience, but I want to get more and put myself out there. And I'm isolated and lonely, even before COVID hit. I go to therapy and am aware of my issues I need to work on as well. With all that in mind... is it really so bad to indulge in this relationship if it keeps away some of the lonely feelings? Even if there's potential unrequited feelings? I've been trying to be happy being by myself since my breakup, and I am to some degree, but I've really just missed companionship, even if it's not real, like when I was with my ex. And how would I even go about starting a conversation about boundaries if I want to try and address how it feels like he's being more emotionally intimate than he claimed?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Am in a FWB with someone who is acting more attached and intimate than I was led to believe they would be, but I kind of like it. Is it okay to keep indulging in this even if it's unrequited? How would I talk about boundaries without scaring him?

Edit: I guess it wasn’t too clear, but I’m not worried about him having feelings for me, it’s that I don’t know how to not start having some feelings for him with how well he treats me, or if it’s even that bad of a thing to pine a little as long as I keep it realistic. I have a hard time believing that this isn’t just how he acts to every woman he’s interested in, after all. I just want some advice on if continuing this FWB situation even while knowing I may have some actual feelings for him is possible. For the record, I also don’t really want an actual relationship since I still don’t feel ready for that, I’m just scared of getting attached in any form and considering us “close” when he said he doesn’t do that, even though that’s how he’s acting. I’m sorry I can’t articulate this well, my feelings are still really jumbled up.",relationships
"Hi reddit, hopefully someone can tell me how to navigate this situation with my sanity intact. I really really love my boyfriend. Like soul mate love. We’ve been together almost two years. When we started to get serious I thought, this is different. I felt at home with him in a way I didn’t think possible and he said he felt the same. We both felt sure early on and moved in together. But little by little, I notice things about him that worry me. He seems to lack empathy. 

The first time I heard him masturbate in bed next to me, I had turned him down for sex maybe 20 minutes ago. (just gotten back from a stressful trip) I felt the blanket pulling on me rhythmically and heard sounds of him touching himself quietly. I just tried to go back to sleep, thinking it was odd that he wouldn’t leave the bed to do that, while I was right next to him. In the morning, I brought it up, “in the future, if you need to masturbate before you go to bed, maybe check if I’m asleep first or just go to the bathroom. He denied VEHEMENTLY. He acted as if I was accusing him of something vile and unthinkable. He says he would never do such a thing, that it would be gross and disrespectful to masturbate next to me. We fight about it for hours and eventually he says “I swear on my mothers grave I did not masturbate.” And at that point I just gave up. 

Now, two months later, in quarantine, It happens again. I hear him touching himself in bed after he’s waited a while for me to fall asleep. This time, though, I can see him doing it because of the mirror on the back of our closet door. It’s also 80 degree weather so no blankets on top of us. I watch him for a while  because I want to make sure I’m not imagining it. 

Then I roll over to try to let him know that I’m awake. He pulls his hands out of his pants and I can see his pulse beating really really fast. He then starts to ACT OUT BEING ASLEEP. He’s exaggerating grinding his teeth really loud, moving around his limbs making facial expressions, covering his crotch with his hands but doing a pretty bad job at looking asleep.  Seriously his heart was beating so hard it looked like a drum in his throat. I knew he was awake just from that. I also watch this guy sleep a fair amount so I know what that actually looks/sounds like. 

He keeps shifting around and after a while (I think he thought I was asleep again?) I see his arm moving very slowly down into his pants again in the mirror. I move around again, he turns away from me, puts a pillow over his crotch. Little later I hear him get out of bed, wash his hands, and come back to bed. When that happened, I felt so extremely uncomfortable that I grabbed a blanket and went to sleep on the couch. 

In the morning he woke me up and immediately started talking sweet to me. Acting like he had no idea what I could be upset about. When I told him what I saw he said “oh, gross” and then he almost admitted to it saying “but you were cool about it last time” 
I reminded him about a couple months ago swearing on his mothers grave that he hadn’t. 
then he started saying things like  “I don’t remember masturbating” “all I remember is eating a lot of pizza and passing out” and went back to playing dumb and laughing me off as if I was being dramatic. 
He hates being “wrong” or  “bad” , hates apologizing, and will fight tooth and nail to avoid blame or fault. So I’m not counting on him opening up anytime soon. I mean, I’d like to think he’s just doing this because he’s really embarrassed. I love him, but if I don’t feel like he’s telling me the truth, I don’t think I can ever trust him again. And the cherry on the cake is that we’re stuck in the same apartment until quarantine restrictions are lifted. 

Is this okay or not? Is there any use trying to figure out why he’s lying about this? And how do I deal with living with him for the next few months if we break up?

TL;DR: I heard my bf masturbating next to me in bed at night, he swore on his mothers grave he hadn’t been. This time I saw him doing it but he’s still denying it. I love him, but if I don’t feel like he’s telling me the truth, I don’t think I can ever trust him again. How do I get him to stop messing with my head?

"So I’m in my first year of grad school, and although I do well, it’s always taken me incalculable amounts of hard work to get good results. Like, very significantly more time and effort that an average person would probably need. Because of that, my parents have discouraged me from trying to get a job until I have my Masters’ degree and no longer need to worry about it interfering with my education. They’re happy to cover my basic expenses until then, and my scholarship takes care of most other things. It’s affordable for us, but I feel absolutely terrible accepting it because I feel like I shouldn’t still be asking them for, like, grocery money at my age. I should be beyond that, you know? I feel like such a burden to them, and a failure as an adult. At this stage, all of my close friends at least have a part-time job and live independently off-campus, and it feels like I’m still a kid while they’ve moved on. I can’t stop myself from thinking that I’m not growing up correctly or quickly enough. I’m also worried that not having ever had any kind of job is going to massively disadvantage me later, since I’ve never had to go through the application or interview processes. I don’t know, I feel like an idiot who doesn’t know how to be a real adult. How do I stop?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I’ve never had a job and am basically relying on my parents and my scholarship for everything, but everyone else around me has one and is moving on with their life. Can’t really start working without having it negatively affect my studies. I feel like a burden and like I should be far more independent by now. How do I stop feeling like this?",relationships
"Thank you in advance for your insights. I’m using my phone to write this and I’ve heard that it can throw the formatting off, so I apologize.

Okay. My boyfriend and I are both in our twenties, almost a year into our relationship, which is long distance right now. Tonight, I asked if he’d told his family about me. He said no, and that when he’d told them about his ex it didn’t go over well, so he wanted to just avoid that. That was hard to hear, as he has met my parents more than once, and I told him I needed some time to think, but would talk to him tomorrow. He said he was sorry if he had somehow hurt my feelings. 

Here’s my problem: one the one hand, I get it. I don’t want to tell him what kind of relationship to have with his parents or force anything. On the other, I really don’t want to be a secret. In a past relationship, my ex told me that he didn’t want to tell his family about me because I was too chubby (not that it matters, but I was a size 4), and they’d make fun of him. That still stings, and I feel really uncomfortable with the idea of being too embarrassing to mention to my partner’s parents. 

I don’t want to cross any boundaries or be dramatic, and I don’t want to feel like I’m guilting my boyfriend into anything. At the same time, it feels really shitty that his family doesn’t know that I exist. 

Am I expecting too much?

" \*I FEEL THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT I AM THE ONE WHO INITIATED THE CONTACT SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GET THE WRONG IDEA. ALSO THE LAW FOR AGE OF CONSENT WHERE I LIVE ALLOWS FOR ALL PERSONS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 16 AND 20 TO HAVE RELATIONS WITH GIVEN CONSENT \*

So I have been working at my job for about 10 months. We have always had a connection but it has always been pretty complicated. For example, a coworker of ours \[18M\] who has come to be one of my best friends and he has a huge crush on her. I am almost certain that she does not have any feelings for him, but she does know that he likes her. The reason I believe this is because often when the three of us are working together the attitude gets pretty negative and toxic.

Anyways, she broke up with her boyfriend and decided to not tell my friend but she did tell me. Right before she told me this I told her that I thought I was in love with her (I also told her that I had been thinking about it for at least 3 months). She didn't really say anything when I told her how I felt but she wanted me to explain why I thought that I did love her. This is when I explained to her how I felt and all of that.

A couple of days later I texted her asking how she felt after I told her. And she said that she was really happy to hear it, but she said that she was also really sad because of our age difference. We then had a conversation about the future between us, and I think we now have a mutual agreement that we really like each other and that we both believe that there is a possible future between us. We also agreed that when I turn 18 in about 7 months if we are still in the same situation then we will give it a shot at a relationship.

I have been scared the whole time I was figuring out my feelings about how she would take the information. This was mostly due to the fact that she is an adult and I am still a kid, and I feel like even if we did date now that I would not be able to be the man she would want to date. I am graduated next week and will be attending the local university next year when I am turning 18 and I'm not sure if I will still work at this place or if I will still talk to her but at the moment I am very flustered.

My main advice that I am looking for is what should I plan for in the future. I truly see a future between the two of us and even if I leave my job and we see each other a lot less I feel like we should stay in touch. I also don't know if I am over thinking it and if things will work themselves out. Thanks in advance for anything you are able to tell me.

"TL;DR: I made an inappropriate joke about my cousin in a private text to my best friend. My cousin snooped through my best friend's phone and found the joke. Our relationship never recovered, but it's been so long now that I don't know if I should apologize or just leave it in the past. 

My step-cousin, Katie, was adopted by her grandparents when she was 6 months old, so this might be a bit confusing. My mom married Katie's uncle/adoptive brother (she calls him uncle) when we were 4 and 2, respectively, and my parents and I all lived in the house next door to my step-grandparents, Gene and Lois, and Katie for several years. I spent upwards of 5 hours at my step-grandparent's house every single day while my parents were at work, so Katie and I were very close but also fought a lot. I think our relationship was strained by our grandma who bought Katie a lot of neat toys, plus consistently gave Katie everything I ever got. My parents weren't well off and I didn't get many toys so it bothered me when I finally got something I was excited about and the next day Katie would have it, too. You know how kids are.

As we got older, Katie would attach herself to my friends. As soon as I made a new friend she would introduce herself to them and invest a lot of effort into making them her new best friend. Two different people told me that she told them some nasty things about me as soon as she met them. It didn't really ever work out for her, but it bothered me a lot. The final time she ever tried to do this turned out especially bad. I still feel guilty for this and this is what my question is about. 

I made a friend who I became especially close with when I was 16. Courtney and I just clicked immediately and to this day we are best friends. Predictably, Katie introduced herself and got Courtney's number. She started texting her a lot and eventually said ""It would be really fun if I stayed at your house for the weekend."" and Courtney said sure. Courtney texted me that she didn't really want Katie to come over, but she didn't know how to say no without sounding mean. We joked about ways she could get out of it and Courtney said ""Maybe she'll die before then. lol jk"" I replied with ""We can only hope. lol"" It was an off color remark, and I realize how awful it sounds. I definitely did NOT want my cousin to die. I was really annoyed by her, but I still loved her. 

While Courtney was in the shower, Katie snooped through her phone. She saw the conversation above and told our grandma and my mom. At the time I was furious that she went through Courtney's phone and that's all I could think about. I said ""It was a joke that she never should have known about it, because she shouldn't have gone through someone else's phone."" My mom actually agreed with me and it died down pretty quickly. My cousin and I completely ignored each other for years. Even in the same room, we acted like the other didn't exist. 

2 years ago I saw her on FB and sent a friend request. She accepted and I had to laugh because her husband has the same name as my ex-husband and she has two children who are the same gender as my kids and almost the same age. I have no doubt that it's a crazy coincidence of course, but given our history it was worth a chuckle. Since then we have tagged each other in a couple of memories from our teen years and shared memes about mutual interests from back then. A few times we've talked about some local drama involving a close family friend. She's invited me to a couple of her kids' birthday parties, but I haven't been able to go to them. 

Overall, it seems she's let go of the past, but sometimes it bothers me. Our grandparents were very emotionally distant and hoarders to boot. She was homeschooled so she didn't get socialization with very many people her age. Her bio parents were awful and she only saw them a handful of times her whole life. I know she was lonely, because she spent a crazy amount of time on online message boards for years. I hate that I added to her misery back then.",relationships
"I need some advice for a very sticky situation. I have to be kind of vague as I don’t know if any of these people involved use reddit.

I moved into a friend’s house far away from my home state recently. Everything is going great! Over the weekend, they had a couple friends over. My friend’s BF introduced me to his friend, who came off as a super nice &amp; fun guy, and I was immediately interested. Apparently, so was he. The next day, he came over and hung out with all of us which was a lot of fun. I told my friend that I was pretty interested in him at that point (but obviously that it was too soon to know for sure). On the third day, he brought me lots of flowers and a gift for my upcoming birthday. I am not going to say specifically what the gift was, but that it wasn’t cheap, but was still a relatively appropriate gift between friends (except that we have only known each other a few days at this point). I thanked him profusely but I had this nagging feeling that things were moving way too fast and started to pull back a little bit. Here’s where it becomes a problem:

HE WONT STOP BUYING ME THINGS/DOING THINGS FOR ME. I work strange hours and he’s frequently at the house, I have come home to various gifts on my bed for the last 2 days. It’s so sweet and I know I sound ridiculously ungrateful but it’s just SO MUCH from someone I’ve known a week. I told him last night that I don’t want him to feel like he needs to buy me stuff/ do me favors/ pay my tab when we order in food/ etc etc etc. He just brushes it off like it’s no big deal. But it is a big deal! Because I’m starting to lose interest with how aggressively into me he is. He asked me last night how much I like him. I said I don’t know how to quantify that and he just pushed me for an answer. That to me feels insecure. He also keeps asking when we can have one on one time again. I’ve explained that I’m super busy with work this week. He doesn’t seem to be getting it. 

I’m getting kind of a desperate vibe and I don’t want to hurt his feelings or make things awkward with my friends but I feel like I’ve been given no choice in the matter and I’m just being cornered into dating someone because I don’t really have a valid reason to not be interested after I said I was. I know no matter what I say it will sound ungrateful after what he’s done for me. I need help! 

Also, I typically don’t let potential SO’s buy anything for me or pay for more than their half of a meal/event/whatever because of this exact scenario and hating to feel like I owe someone. If I’m in a relationship, I see it differently. 

TL;DR
A guy I’ve known for just under a week keeps doing overly nice things and spending money on me to the point where I am starting to get uncomfortable and don’t know how to get out of this situation.",relationships
"We've been married about 5 years and we just bought a house together. Recently, my husband has been looking for more friends and gravitates towards female friendships. I don't have an issue with his friends because they are nice and respectful of me. I don't suspect anything going on right now, but lately I feel like he's prioritizing his relationships with them over his relationship with me.

We had a female roommate \[30\] who was a mutual friend of ours, and we've known her for a few years, and have mutual friends with her. Literally, a week after she moved in, my husband's attitude towards her drastically changed. He says she ruined our first time home experience, and long story short, she moved out before she originally planned to. Our relationship with her is still good, but it made for an uncomfortable living situation for a few months. 

Now, he had made a new female friend \[28\], and he just asked me if she could live with us, rent free, and for an indefinable amount of time because she's having a rough time at her parent's house. I have no clue what the issues are and he couldn't tell me either. If I knew it were an abusive situation, I would definitely let her find refuge here, but it sounds like she is just fighting for space, which we are limited in supplying here. 

Naturally, I brought up the old roommate situation and that we don't know this girl well enough to invite her to live with us. He was upset and told me it wasn't the same and she didn't even have to move all her stuff in here. I left the conversation with ""I'm going to sleep on it,"" but I definitely know that the answer is NO.

He has another close female friend who he works with, and they are reading buddies. She told him that she had problems with other married male friends and that she needed my number to talk to me before becoming friends with him. I texted her and she is nice and all, but I am left to wonder what makes her so threatening to other wives? The only thing that annoys me is that he will read all these books she recommends and takes the same advice that I give him, but only when she also gives him the advice. I feel like he values her opinions more than mine, but if I bring this up, I'm just jealous and we're not like that and blah blah blah.

Is this all normal? Am I overthinking these relationships that he has? We have a great relationship together other than this, and things aren't usually hard to talk about. However, when I have a concern, I am told I am jealous and that I don't have to be.

TLDR: Husband has 2 new female friendships that he is becoming more invested in. I feel like he's valuing these women a little more than me right now. I confronted him, and he tells me that I'm jealous and that we are better than that. I don't want his one friend whom I've only spoken to maybe 3 times to move in with us, and I am concerned that he values his work friend's opinions more than mine. He'll take my advice when she approves it. He hasn't known these women a year yet.",relationships
"So my BF of seven months broke up with me out of the blue a week ago and I'm over it, but I'm beginning to realize I never want to have anything to do with him again. I didn't talk to him immediately after the breakup because that's just my automatic response - I don't want to say anything I would regret later, so I just stay silent.

After the first couple days, though, I realized I can't even look at our photos together anymore. I unfollowed him everywhere and blocked him on Messenger so that he couldn't message me. It's been a minute and I have absolutely no desire to unblock him or, to be frank, interact with him in any way. Is this normal, or am I overreacting?

He broke up with me in a civil manner and there was no fight or anything, but I was really hurt by it because of the reasons he gave for why he wants to break up. It was an LDR, so he talked about things like distance, which is perfectly understandable. He also talked about ""social differences"" between the two of us, for example, which absolutely rubbed me the wrong way. Overall, I got the impression that he'd been thinking about breaking up with me for a while, but if that was indeed the case, he certainly didn't let it on. I felt, and still feel, lied to. I also feel like I didn't get as much love in return as I put into the relationship (he talked about how he can't love me the way I deserved which... is pretty bad, in my opinion).

He explicitly mentioned how he wants to stay friends but I don't even want to keep him in my life as a friend. Am I overreacting?

For context, here's the translated breakup message:
""I know you're not gonna freak out so... do you think we could be just friends again? I have a whole lot of things ahead of me and you wanna go back to school... I dunno, I feel like there's more and more of a social gap between us? That's fine with friends but it's a bit of a problem in a relationship. But it's definitely not because you're doing anything wrong, you're just doing things differently. I definitely don't want you to not go back to school ""because of me"" because I'm really happy for you, I'm glad you got accepted into archival studies. I just can't imagine how things would work between us. Honestly, I think I might've reached a point where I can't have a lasting relationship because so many things are just about to change. If you want to pretend we're still dating I'm fine with that, I get it's an important achievement for you, but I just don't know about this. I've been thinking really hard about this for the past few days  and I didn't know how to tell you, but I think it'd be better if we just broke up. It can be an indefinite breakup, it's definitely not that I don't love you. I just don't love you as much as you deserve.""

TL;DR: BF broke up with me and it wasn't a bad breakup but I don't want to speak to him ever again. Is that reasonable?",relationships
"Apologies now, this is going to be long and I can't figure out good tl:dr. Maybe by the end I'll have one.

My bf/fiancé (39m) and I are currently in our biggest fight ever. He is currently hiding in our garage, having pretended to leave.  This past weekend was mother's day. On Friday night, after I got off work, he said ""I bought a -bunch of stuff- at the store today, I have $6 left. What do you want for mother's day?"" I replied I didn't want anything, he didn't have to spend money. To clarify, I have 3 boys. Son #1 is 20, son #2 is 15 (both with ex-husband) and son #3 is 4, (bf is father). He has been off work due to Covid since the beginning of March. I have what's deemed an essential job, and have been working 40+ hours a week. I really didn't expect him to spend money. A picture of all of them together, a drawing or art project of some kind with my youngest, painted rocks, etc. would have been perfect. Instead, he flat out tells me that he forgot about mother's day on Friday. I had some errands to run that night. I took all the kids with me, so he would have some alone time since neither one of us really gets any with the quarantine going on.  I call him at 6:30 and ask him if he wants us to make dinner or for me to just pick up some take out, since I still need to run son #2 to ex's to pick up homework he forgot and will be at least another 30-40 minutes getting home. It's been a very long day at this point, it's hot out, I'm tired. He hems and haws about cooking or take out, not making a decision, I've had it,  and say ""for fuck's sakes can somebody besides me make a decision on something for once!"" (I make the dinner menu and the grocery list every week and do all the grocery shopping). He elects to make dinner. Great, I'll be home in 30-40 minutes, about the time it takes to make the recipe for dinner.  2 hours after this conversation (8:30 pm) dinner is ready. I haven't eaten all day, so I know if I eat dinner I will get violently ill. I sit at the dinner table with son's, waiting for BF.  Son #2 asks if I am eating, I barely shake my head, explaining that I didn't have lunch so if I eat know I will get sick. BF gets mad and storms off, refuses to eat dinner or speak to me for the rest of the night.  Saturday we had planned a BBQ. It had been a long week at work for me (long quarter really), and the first nice weather in my area this year. I wanted to go outside and enjoy the sun, but was stuck in the kitchen prepping things for dinner. He came inside, taking a break from playing with our son outside, and said ""Man it's nice out there"". I replied with ""I wouldn't know, but it looks nice"". Kinda snarky, I know. I didn't want to be in the kitchen making dinner for everyone by myself, since I am also the one who planned the menu and did the grocery shopping, on top of working.  He got upset and left.  Came back an hour later and asked if he could help, at which point I was pretty much done. I told him as much, to which he said that he tried to help, I just wasn't letting him.  I responded with ""and yet you are just standing there, not doing anything. That's not helping"". Admittedly at this point I already knew that he had not planned anything for mother's day, that I would not be getting a gift and was feeling hurt, and reacting from that. He stormed off and didn't speak to me the rest of the day. He elected to spend Saturday night sleeping in his truck.  Sunday morning, I hear him telling my older kids they have to sign their names and trying to get the youngest to write his name.  He apparently spent Saturday night drawing a card for me, that he wanted the boys to sign (I know it was Saturday night because I used the laptop that night, and then again Sunday morning and a Google search for ""calligraphy thank you"" was up that was new since Saturday).  At this point, I am hurt and angry because of the lack of planning, thought and effort.  I don't say anything for the entire day, because I don't trust myself to not hurl insults or degrading and hurtful barbs, since that is how my ex and I used to fight, which he knows.  We spend all of Sunday not speaking. Monday morning I go to work, and while waiting until it's time to clock in, I'm scrolling FB. I keep seeing all these posts about how great a Mother's day everyone had. I react and post ""Another shitty holiday done and gone. Can't wait for the next one /s"".  He then texts me pissed off that I'm dragging his name through the mud, making him look bad to everyone I know, and gives me options 1, 2 and D. Basically, he says option 1 is he leaves like I want, option 2 is I drag his name through the mud and make him look like a piece of shit, option d is we talk like adults.  I respond with, 

 ""I didn't bad mouth you to anyone, simply stated I had a shitty mother's day, which I did.  Not because you did not spend money,  but because you put 0 thought or effort into it. Mother's day is the second Sunday in May.  Every year. It doesn't change. Plenty of time for you to have planned for it. A whole year in fact.  So many things, that don't cost money, that could have been done instead of making it, and me, feel like an unimportant burden. 

At this particular moment in time,  yes, I would like you to leave. I don't want to be around you right now. For how long, I don't know. Will I feel the same in a half hour or later tonight? I don't know.  All I know is at this moment, I am so incredibly angry and hurt that I can spend so much time and effort, everyday, all year, to care for and help all of you, to recognize your special days, to let you know that I notice your needs and think about you not just on holidays/birthdays, but all the time. And I cannot get even a small percentage of that in return.""

(Some examples of things I do: he started a new hobby of baking bread, so I bought him bread proofing bowls. Notice a stain on his shirt? Buy him new shirts. Mentions pants are getting tight? New pants. Wants to plant a garden? Helps plant, care for, harvest and store everything. He hasn't seen his dad in 20 years and his dad has never met his son? Yeah, found a way to pay for a trip across the entire country for all of us, planned and paid for everything. He wants to go to school? Become sole income earner to make it possible for him to focus on school. Not to mention all the daily tasks, bills, special gifts, etc that I take care off.)

Not the best way to handle things on my end, I know.  In my defense, in 7 years together, I have had 2 good holidays total. Mother's day 3 years ago when we went to a Lego store and I bought myself a gift, and last Christmas (which was right after he tried to cheat on me and a long story in itself).

So after that exchange, he is now hiding in our garage, pretending that he's left. Except our 4yo knows he's out there and is very confused and upset that daddy won't let him in the garage or come out and play with him. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to just give up, especially since we have a young son together who won't understand, and it may make son's developmental delays worse. But there are so many other things besides this past weekend that make me think it's never going to work. Even after being in counseling for over a year, nothing is getting better. 

Tl:dr- fiancé puts no effort into Mother's day, multiple fights ensue which result in him hiding in garage, pretending to have left, and confusing young son.",relationships
"I'm 17 years old and my sister/cousin(she's not my bio sister) who is 20 years old is starting to avoid me for some reason. I've started to notice that when I leave my room and go downstairs her door is wide open but when I return to mines she shuts it for whatever reason. Also when I get dinner she waits for me to return to my room and close my door before she gets hers

Very recently she was sitting on the couch and I think she thought I didn't see her because there's a wall partially blocking the view when you go down the stairs. So she left asap back to her room after I went into the garage.

We've only been close when we were younger, before middle school after that it went downhill. A month ago I tried to get something out of her like greeting her just by saying hi and that wont even work. Now she doesn't even interact with me even when shes with my mom.

My dad died this January and he wanted us to get closer since he knew that he was going to die sometime soon because of his cancer. He talked to us about this maybe 1-2 years ago and obviously none of this has worked out. I can't speak to her about this because its weird we don't talk to each other at all, and I literally know nothing about her and her life other than what she does for work and where she goes to school.

Its now starting to affect me since now whenever she is with my mom or downstairs I just stay in my room because of what shes doing and when I even see her she never speaks. And since my dad is gone now I'm only really close to my mom and not any of my relatives like my grandma or anyone else really its just weird that shes even here.                                                                                 
Any suggestions that doesn't involve me directly speaking to her about this? Because I doubt she will be in my life if she ever moves out which is ok with me but I would like to have a relationship on some level due to her being apart of my family

 TL;DR : My sister is avoiding me all the time and its weird and I don't know what to do if even to do anything",relationships
"hey so this happened a few months ago, towards the end of the last semester. I haven’t spoken about this with anyone but now with the quarantine it’s been difficult to keep myself distracted. this is my first time posting I hope it’s right community. 

He was in my class but we didn’t really meet until 2 weeks before the semester ended. When I met him something just clicked, he was one of those people that we could just sit around and laugh for hours on end, everything always seemed so funny. We went to a commuters school and after class we’d hang out on campus for a few hours and get coffee or whatever. 

When the semester ended we met a few times somewhere in between us, we live about an hour and 15 minutes away but public transport. 

One day he invited me to his apartment to hang out. It was still a little awkward between us being unsure where we stand. By this point we had kissed a few times but nothing too crazy. I decided to go sounded like a fun night. 

We spent about a half hour on the couch watching the office and it was pretty clear that neither of us were comfortable on the “couch” that barely fit 2 people. So he suggested we move to the bed an we can continue the episode in the other room. 

Me being me I jumped on to his bed laying across it facing the tv. He looked at me standing across the room and said “what the fuck are you doing get your dirty cloths of my bed” 

I thought he was joking so I laughed it off. And he said it again this time he really sounded angry “get your dirty clothes off my bed” and he climbed on top of me pressing his hips against mine. At this point I was started to feel afraid still hoping he’s just playing around. He was upset that I was wearing my clothes from outside on his bed but he’s the one that suggested moving to the bed. I tried to tell him to get off of me as he put ran his hands down my body on to my hips. suddenly “get your dirty clothes off my bed” changed to “take your fucking clothes on” and when I said no he seemed more confused than anything else. The confusion quickly turned to anger and he started to yell at me. He pinned my arms above my head and said every terrible thing imaginable to me. And the worst part? I believed it. I believed that I ruined his night and that I was such a horrible person for not fucking him the least I can do is let him get upset. I finally said something, told him to stop to let me go and he moved his hand from my wrist to my throat, there was a second there where I really couldn’t breath. I moved his hand from my throat and he started running up and down my body again. He hurt me and left bruises across my whole body. I knew I was in a bad situation but I kept telling myself that it wasn’t so bad and that I probably deserved it. I kept telling myself that if it got any worse I’ll do something I’ll fight back but never actually did. He finally stopped and I left his apartment immediately on the brink of tears. 

This experience stung especially hard since at that point I’d already have been training seriously in self defense for a year and a half. I’ve gotten really good and knew that if I did fight back I would’ve won I would’ve been okay but I didn’t. 

I went to class a few days later and my instructor noticed the bruises on my arm and asked me about them. Everyone else figured I got them from there but he would’ve known. He’s the only person I wanted to tell this too and he gave me so many opportunities to but I was afraid of how he’d react. At the time I convinced myself that if he knew the truth he wouldn’t want to train me anymore, and think that I’m a waste of his time. I’ve been feeling very guilty about this whole situation especially when I was training I felt like a fraud. And now that I feel okay talking about it I wouldn’t even know how to bring it up again. 

I guess what I’m asking is for the people who ever experience an event like this how did people react when you told them? 
And if someone shared a story like this before did you look at them differently because of it? 

Tldr: went to a guys apartment and he hurt me for wearing my clothes from outside on his bed and I didn’t fight back.",relationships
"I don't feel like my relationship with my closest friend of 2 years will last long. Relationship as in the exclusive kind.

I'm 24 female and he is 19.

I feel like it's kind of my fault we went onto being exclusive. Before it was brought up, he asked me to be loyal to him because ""we are a little more than friends"". This just confused me so I questioned what we are and that's how we ended up where we are.

His affection heavily grew and I really love where we are but it doesn't feel like a long-term thing. I'm sad to be having to admit that.

The first reason that comes to mind is that we are online friends, meaning this is a long distance relationship. He has plans for settlement in a few years and though I know stuff can change until then, I think he would want something else other than a long distance relationship as time passes because of this.

The next reason is my life. I'm a heavily demotivated, lonely, unsuccessful and depressed (I'm not diagnosed but this is how I feel since I don't even feel sad) person. That's why I even doubt how he could love me a lot in this way. I'm scared he may grow tired of what I'm doing with my life.

The third reason is that I'm, obviously, an overthinking and really insecure person. My personality might ruin this relationship. He is already kind of annoyed by my overthinking, though he keeps continuously telling me to say whatever is on my mind to him and he talks it out with me, tries to reassure me. I just think he may grow tired of this. I myself don't want to be a person like this but this is what I keep ending up doing. He even has once called me dramatic, telling me I come up with something though there is no problem and that's someone I don't want to be **at all**.

Overall, I don't think I'm that good of a person and I don't feel like this relationship is good enough for him.

This is where my insecurity hits. I'm not that charming of a person and he feels out of my league; I'm so sure he can do way better than me and this relationship. We are all human, isn't it only natural to thrive for what is better for us or do I know wrong? I feel like, as time passes, he will be uninterested in me and love me less or he may even find someone along the way, someone who is better to him than I can ever be; at that point, I **think** he would rather pursue that relationship rather than a long distance relationship with someone like me.

Though, as a little side note, I'm not saying that we must be in this relationship. I'm scared of the outcome of the possible break-up. When for whatever reason, he breaks up with me, we may grow distant. I'm really comfortable with the connection we have going on right now and I wouldn't want that to change; that outcome would hurt me but I wouldn't want him to force a connection he is uninterested in for me either because that would hurt more. I wouldn't like forcing him into something though he says nobody can force him into anything. Another possible outcome is that we completely cut off contact. I can get used to being alone again really fast but I would much prefer him still being in contact with me.

At this point, I don't know how to ease my mind. I just want to tell him all about what I think/feel but that feels like a risky move though we have talked about many things.

TLDR I feel like our relationship won't last long because of my insecurities and don't know how to ease my mind about the possible consequences of the break up.

This is a repost because I realized I need to actually have insight on this from people.",relationships

Jen has always been problematic and has had numerous failed relationships which end in dramatic fashion. Very early on in Josh and Jens relationship she was accusing him of various things and fabricating stories about him and even lied to Abbey about things I had never said in an attempt to break Abbey and I up. 

We've since taken a step back from Jen and her behaviour at the detriment of my relationship with Josh until another of their recent breakups. He spilled the beans and told me about all of the horrible and abusive things she would say to him, gas-lighting, victim blaming, the only thing I'm not certain of yet is if she has physically abused him. She is also controlling and will send him abusive messages if she finds out he has spoken to female coworkers, or cause an argument before he is due to attend family gatherings so he cannot make it as he doesn't feel right.

It sickened me to know how she was treating somebody I loved and I told him that I dislike Jen not only because of how she has acted towards Josh but also towards myself and Abbey in the past. 



My brother has since been in touch and told me he's going to give it another shot with Jen and wants me to patch things up with her which I really do not want to do but if I refuse, I risk pushing my brother away.

" 

Hi guys,

 I've recently reached a point in my relationship where I feel like I need to make a decision sooner rather than later. I've been in the happiest relationship of my life for 1.5 years with my amazing boyfriend. We've been living together for about 6 months. He's expressed wanting to marry me eventually and we are indeed building a life together (our apartment, we have two cats together). Our relationship is great, but recently I've started thinking if this is really the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. But a few concerns have come up:

1. I really value running, hiking, and being physically active. It does wonders for my mental health and I grew up with two parents who ran marathons, biked 30 miles for fun, and really instilled in us the beauty and transcendence in simply running or biking. My partner has little value in these things. I feel like I have to drag him to bike with me. He will never, ever run. Has barely gone to the gym. He's a bit overweight and I fear when we get older he will have health problems and be a bad role model for the importance of physical activity and eating healthy to our future children (this has little to do with appearance, I am extremely attracted to him)
2. There is still part of me that wants to experience other men... it comes and goes. Sometimes I fantasize about other men and what it would be like if I were with them. I've always struggled with being a free spirit and not wanting to settle down. I would never, ever cheat on him and have barely flirted with another guy throughout my relationship. But I do miss the excitement of a random hook up here and there.
3. He plays a ton of video games and it drives me crazy. I understand its his way to decompress after work but he will be up until 2am on a week night and complain about being tired the next day.
4. I love him but I'm not ready to get married and have kids anytime soon. I feel like my clock is ticking. It's a really weird place to be in.
5. Sometimes I feel like I'm settling for him. As I said, he's wonderful. But I know I'm very comfortable right now with our relationship and don't want to look back in 10 years and think ""why did I marry this person?""

Thoughts? 

TL;DR : How to I figure this out as soon as possible? I'd love to hear people's experiences with mid-20's relationships and how and why they turned out, for the good or the bad.",relationships
"I recently found out that all the emotions I have been dealing with have a name...retroactive jealousy.

I've been dating this guy for 4 years, and he's my first BF. I met him when I was 22 and he was 26 and he has a LOT more experience than me, both physically and emotionally. He has 3 prior GFs, one of which he dated for 3 years. He is my 1st BF and even before him, I'd only had sex a few times.

Over the past year, I've discovered SO much information about his past relationships, through stalking his phone, social media, exes social media and just dragging the info out of him.

The weird thing is - this all started after our 3rd year anniversary - before this, I was NEVER the jealous type (like I had never even experienced the feeling of jealousy!!). Around this time, my parents tried to get me to break up with my BF (for cultural reasons - mainly the fact that I'm a doctor and he does not come from a wealthy background/family or have a job that they deem acceptable). After this, all the curiosity about his past started.

I've been seeing a therapist who has been helpful, making me realise that it is MY issue and not his, but she does not think this is RJ - she thinks it's related to my anxiety issues, low self-esteem and my parents disapproval.

I should mention, that before all of this, we were super happy and had no issues - but now, I'm feeling really unstable and can't seem to stop the thoughts that come into my head. Like picturing them in bed (even while we are doing stuff together), picturing them in love etc. He can literally be talking about the most random thing, and I will link it to an ex. Like for example, the other day he complimented me on my green eyes, and I thought back to his previous ex with green eyes. It's really hard because I know I'm hurting myself.

Curious if anyone has successfully dealt with this issue...I'm hoping that this is mainly a symptom of how hard it has been dealing with the family conflict, rather than an internal issue with me :(

"Me (29M) and my wife (28F) have been married for 6 years coming up in a few weeks. We have two young kids together. About two years ago I found out she was texting back and forth with a guy and had sent some inappropriate photos of herself in her underwear and inappropriate text messages. I calmly confronter her about it at the time and told her how much it hurt me and that it was a problem and not something I could live with and she agreed it was a mistake and that she would immediately stop all contact. So fast forward to last night. She was acting distant and on her phone a whole lot. I knew we would be at her parent's house for Mother's day so the kids and I made her dinner on Saturday night. So the kids and I are eating dinner and she is just kind of hovering around the table on her phone but not interacting with us. I say something about it and she brushes it off but I don't want to make a big deal cause it's supposed to be her nice mother's day diner. After dinner, I clean up and put the kids to bed. When I come downstairs shes on her computer in the living room. I sat down next to her and she almost immediately gets up and moves to the kitchen. I figured she was getting a drink but she stays in the kitchen on her phone for an hour then goes straight upstairs to bed without saying a word to me. Something about the way she was acing didn't seem quite right to me so I looked at the iPad that is synched with her messages to see what was up. It was about 930 PM and there were no messages since 6. I started to feel somewhat sick to my stomach because it was clear she was direct messaging someone and it wasn't email/work-related and she was hiding it. I got into her Instagram account and found she was messaging back and forth with the same guy as 2 years ago. There were a lot of photos sent that disappear after viewing(i don't really use social media so I'm not sure the correct term or how they work). There were also thousands upon thousands of messages between them. I only scrolled about a day but she had invited him to join her for her shower ( the shower she was taking while I was making her dinner downstairs with her children) she told him she loved him, she repeatedly asked to hang out with him and when they could meet up. I really only got about a day back in the history before I became too distraught but from the timestamp, I could tell she told this man she loved him while she was laying in bed with me the night before.

I went upstairs and woke her up and confronted her about it. Things got heated and she called her father crying to come to pick her up. He did come to pick her up and took her back to his house leaving me with the children. Her father and I are very close and we talked today and he said he talked with her at great length and that what she did was wrong but that im basically overreacting to a few inappropriate text messages and that nothing actually happened so its not a huge deal. He says that if she actually wanted to have an affair she just would have and if she actually wanted to leave me she would have. I can't help but feel that she has completely betrayed me and my children and that even if there was no physical aspect (though it was certainly heading in that direction) she has been having an emotional affair.

tl;dr: I found out wife is having an emotional affair and FIL thinks its not a big deal

"I was seeing this guy for about 6 months and we quickly started spending a lot of time together. He had a really good paying job, owned his own business and everything. He used to buy me little gifts here and there and bring me out on many date nights. I always showed my appreciation.

Early on he asked me to e-transfer x amount to this e-mail (said it was a shipping company, another time it was a graphic designer) I thought it was weird to ask someone you just met but I did it anyway because I want to be helpful and I just felt uncomfortable saying no. He asked me several times because he said his bank had a transfer limit which he showed me - he always paid me back full in cash.

Anyway slowly these requests kept building up and the amount went over a grand. He paid me back mostly but still owes me a couple hundred dollars. I politely mentioned it today and he accused me of not appreciating the jewellery he purchased for me. I said I would rather have money for tuition, he said he would pay me back less than what he owed me if I gave him back the jewelry. This guy has showed me his bank account before and he is loaded, so what's the big deal? He makes so much more money than me but he gets offended when I ask for it back. I dont know if I have a job to go back to after the pandemic so I'm trying to save up. I kept thinking maybe I was being scammed the whole time but he has never attempted to ghost me. He has continued to speak to me even through the pandemic when we weren't seeing each other. I reassured him that I appreciate him and have also been the one to give gifts too. He just unfriended me on Facebook, I feel stupid because I think I was probably scammed the whole time.

" 

People   of Reddit, last year in august my girlfriend broke up with me, because   she meant not to love me anymore. We found back together after a few   days and I found out why she thought so. Over the years I stopped beeing   the man i used to be. In our earlier years I brought her flowers and   other little attentions and presents (nothing to expensive, just to show   her my attention). I stopped doing that in the last years, I don't  know  why. I think it was the life routine and the wrong thought she  would  love me without this proofs of my love.

We   found back together then and I started making her presents to proof my   love, everything was fine but the routine we were in before came back   very quick and she thinks, again, that she doesn't love me.

I   think she is the love of my life and I want her back. Should I try   again to get her back and promise her not to fall back to the routine we   were in before? How can i protect me from falling back? Making  presents  etc. is not my own way to show my love, it is to be near,  listen,  cuddling and stuff like that. It's hard for me to learn her way  of  loving to show her my love.

I did not text or call her in the last two weeks, to give her some space.

What do you guys think? And pls excuse my not perfect english, it's not my native language.

"We’ve been together for 4 years starting in 11th grade of high school. We grew up in a small town together. But first year college brought us to separate cities. We continued with long distance but our relationship struggled through this time. She didn’t make very many friends and dropped out after fall semester.

Next year she transferred schools so that we’d be in the same city. We had a great time that year but again, she never really made friends of her own so she was always spending time at my place with my friends. My school friends liked her, and she was included as a friend of theirs too, not just my girlfriend. Summer passed and as we entered our junior year of college, everything was smooth sailing, until the end of this April. Out of no where, she started to become very distant and then 2 weeks ago broke up with me. She told me that she “wants to know what it’s like to do things on her own”, and “feels like we are both missing out on the young part of our life’s”. This really hurt me hard but I let her go without much resistance because I just want her to be happy. I really don’t understand what her reasoning means.

Today she came to drop my things off and we talked for a while. We hugged and cried and she said “I still care a lot about you but I think this will be better for both of us. I just need to know what it’s like to be alone, how to things alone. Doesn’t it scare you that you haven’t really had to do anything by yourself?” I still love her and want her back but I also don’t want to accidentally push her away further. 

I’m living alone and she’s living with her family in our home town. We share lots of the same friends here so I will likely see her around. I don’t know wether I should pursue getting back with her? How should I go about getting her back?

"Hello dear r/relationships.

I apologize for the bad formatting, I'm on mobile and not very knowledgeable on posting.

This will probably be quite long since I have to include some background information for better understanding.
If you want to read through all of it, thank you so much.
For the ones who don't, there will be a tldr at the bottom.
I will try to summarize as best as I can.


Yesterday my bf came home from work, we cuddled a bit on the bed and started browsing reddit on his phone.
He wanted to show me something, clicked the search bar and lo and behold, the two top recent results showed the name of what obviously was a nsfw sub as well as that sub's name added with the name of the country we're in.
I don't remember the exact name of the sub, but the name itself established pretty quickly that this is not for innocent eyes.

I was devastated.
I still don't know how I managed to do it but I asked him right then and there what that is.
He instantly got this sad guilty look in his eyes and answered honestly, telling me it's a sub where people post where they're from and then describe in detail what kind of stuff they're into. Basically a sub with erotic literature where you can meet with people irl and hookup, you get the gist.
He said he's discovered it a few days ago only.

I can't remember anymore what exactly happened after that.
I think I cried a bit and he tried to console me by saying he still loves me and that he would never cheat on me, that he only visited the sub to masturbate. According to his words, he only ever searched his specific country up because he was curious whether this kind of culture really existed here.

All of this leads us to the reason why he did this in the first place, and you can probably guess it.
We haven't had sex in about two weeks now.
One reason for that is that I had my period last week.
The other is a bit more complicated I'm afraid. (Sorry for tmi in advance!)

I've always had trouble with intimacy.
It started with my very first relationship if you can even call it that.
I was a naive 16 year old. He made me do things I didn't want to do and shamed me for not being good enough at what he wanted. In the end he discarded me for his best friend.
Then a few years later I got into an emotionally and mentally abusive relationship with a narcissist. He would ask for nudes regularly and whenever I said no, he would start showing me pictures of his oh-so-perfect ex, telling me how beautiful and sexy she was and wondering why he even left her in the first place.
Last but not least, the person I was with prior to my current relationship was a heavy reddit user, only following nsfw subs where women posted pictures of their private parts. He openly showed me. I do not know whether he was in private contact with any of these women but I think it not unlikely.
Funnily enough he didn't touch me in a sexual way one single time in the few months we wasted on each other.
As a result of all of this I have become very sensitive to sexual touches and am very unsure of how to act in sexual situations because I always feel like there's one correct way of behaving which I'm just not good enough at. I have to be in a certain state of mind to fully let go of fear and control.

So there you have it.
I have pretty much never had any positive experiences when it comes to sex and as a result I think of myself as dysfunctional and broken. Intimacy both intrigues and scares me deeply.

I love my boyfriend dearly.
He knew about my fears before we really started becoming involved with each other. He didn't shame or ridicule me but was compassionate and understanding and I value him very highly. I see a future with him and I don't want to lose him.

Last night we had a heart to heart.
He said he doesn't want to lose me either and that he will wait for me as long as needed until I'm ready (for context: Usually we're intimate around once, sometimes twice a week. Things have died down recently due to uni stress, my anxiety rising as well as me having my period recently.).
He says for him there's much more to our relationship than just sex. He says he does find me attractive and sexy and all that stuff.
I told him I don't know how to feel or what to do about the entire situation.
Part of me does believe he didn't use that sub to look for people to fuck, that he only got into it for the writing and the dirty talk, that he only used it to relieve himself. He even said he imagines me doing and saying all the things those women write about, but I don't know whether to believe that.
I don't consider what he did cheating, but it definitely is a grey area to me. I told him so and he said he won't do it again.

Reddit, I am so heartbroken.
I want to punch and hug him at the same time, but it's so hard even looking at him.
I honestly feel that with time and patience I can get through this, but I'm also thinking about the influence my shitty past has over both him and me and how it affects us.
I feel like I can't give him what he wants and deserves and that he's better off with someone who can satisfy not just his emotional but also his sexual needs.
I want to fight through my own fears and doubts for and with him, but only time can tell how long it'll take and I can't let him wait forever.

What should I do? What should we both do? Please help.


I am so sorry for rambling and for weird structuring. My head is hurting so bad.
To everyone who took the time to read and/or even comment, thank you so much.


Tldr: Bf was on sub for random hookups, said it was to help him fap since we haven't been intimate in around two weeks. I think the underlying issue is that I can't fully satisfy him sexually because of shitty past induced fears and anxieties.

"I am confused, and frankly really hurt. A while ago, like maybe 40-50 days now, my sister and my girlfriend ended up seeing each other in the park and chatted a bunch apparently. They made plans to meet up the next day to walk their dogs together and hang out. According to my girlfriend, my sister started telling her all of this crazy stuff about me. She specifically said that I 'struggled with alcoholism' a while ago. My sister has never really drank much, whereas I partied quite a lot and drank in college quite a bit, but jesus christ, I was never an alcoholic or anything close to it. Its never been something she has ever brought up to me. She also said I abused drugs a lot, and she asked my girlfriend if I still did. Abused drugs? Seriously? I did some drugs, very very occasionally, but the only evidence my sister had of that was literally one time I told her I did molly at a picnic with some friends when I was 18. The only other example I could think of was that she found out I had a summons when I was 18 for having a beer in the park, but that is the most minor shit imaginable in new york. She just said a bunch of stuff then about how I had a really crazy, rough, hard life and that she hopes I am doing better with my GF and that I am making better choices. It was a bit more than that, but you get the gist. My GF was shocked, not at the 'new information' my sister was saying, but that my sister would have the audacity to say this stuff in the first place. My girlfriend already knows I am a normal guy, she's met my friends and knows my job and all that. 

&amp;#x200B;

In case it wasn't very obvious, I don't talk to my sister. We don't hate each other... we just don't talk very much at all. But holy shit, I had no idea she thought of me as some depressed drug addict maniac. And frankly, why the fuck did she even say that stuff? Does she like, resent me? did she actually believe the hyperbole she was saying? I couldn't even comprehend what I was hearing when my GF told me. I called my sister, no response. For 3 days. I called her apartment, and her roommate picked up and said that she was at work. I called back like a week later, and the roommate said the same thing. I called my mom, and she said she had just chatted to my sister right before I called. I on-and-off tried to get in contact for over a month, no response, ever. Eventually the roommate even stopped responding. I wanted to tell my mom the issue... but I didn't want her knowing what my sister said for partially obvious reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the fuck is going on? I still cannot comprehend why she said those things. Does she go around telling other people those things? My aunts and uncles and cousins? Her friends? What do I do? I've sent texts obviously, asking her why she said those things. I even tried email.

"A little bit of context :

I have a friend, let's call her M, who thinks of me as her only best friend. We've known each other for nearly 3 years now. I've always felt a blockage towards her but tried over and over again to think of M as my best friend. I recently found that I just wasn't captivated by her and that this friendship could probably never work from my side (I need to be attracted and captivated by someone to pour my entire heart in a relationship).

My main question is as follow : should I tell her I can't continue this friendship before or after I give her a birthday present ?

M gave me for the first time a birthday present this year. Her birthday is later this year and I don't know if I should give her one (which would be the first birthday present I give her) to be ""fair"". I don't know if she'll think ""I gave her a present but she didn't give me one"" if our friendship ends before I give her a present. But then, it's kind of weird if I give her a present and tell her the moment after (or some days later) that I can't continue to act as her best friend. What timing would you recommend me ?

My other question is : is it okay if I explain why I can't be her friend anymore in a letter rather than orally ?

I'm sure that if I have to explain to her everything face to face, I'll say things without paying close attention not to hurt her and end up in deep shit (there's the pressure of time when you talk, you can't really think things thorough). On the other hand, I can choose my words with care in a letter and say everything without forgetting important things. However, saying these kinds of things in a letter could be seen as cowardice.

I considered meeting her and handing her a letter and wait until she finished reading it so we could talk after that, but honestly, I'm kind of at a loss as what to do. In the end, those things hurt but you've got to do it some day... I just want to know what socially intelligent people would do.

"Obligatory backstory:

I am a 21 year-old female, and my (now former) best friend is also a 21 year-old female. I'm gonna call her Taylor for the purposes of the story. We were born a month apart and our mothers worked (and still work) for the same business. Naturally, they decided to have us play together as babies. From infancy, we were inseparable. Many of my happiest childhood memories involve her. We were thick as thieves and even when we had a falling out in late middle school (completely unrelated story that we later agreed was just a symptom of middle school being horrible for everyone) we still cared deeply for each other and soon enough, rekindled our friendship. It was like we picked back up in the prime of our friendship. That small period of time when we weren't best friends seemed completely ridiculous and inconsequential. Now, Taylor was like my sister. We knew almost everything going on in each other's lives, we thought of the other's parents as our own extra set of parents, we didn't have to hide anything around each other. I was convinced we'd be each other's maid of honor at our weddings and godmothers to each other's potential kids. THAT type of friendship.

Well, in college, things started to change as they do when two friends go to separate schools, but only in that we started carving out our adult identities. Our paths of interest went in different directions but we still remained best friends. Of course, we didn't talk quite as frequently as we had before college, but we always championed and supported each other's choices, and we always had a blast when we were together; driving around aimlessly, getting coffee together at our favorite coffee shop, shooting dirty looks at each other's exes when we saw them and giggling like little kids every chance we got.

The first time I noticed any sort of red flag was within this past year. Like I said before, we were born a month apart, and we were both about to turn 21 (her first). Our colleges are only about an hour's drive from each other at most. Our mutual friend also goes to my school, so I drove the two of us plus my boyfriend up for Taylor's party, even though it was super late at night and I had work the next day. The next month, my roommates had planned an amazing 21st birthday party, and one of my other closest friends drove up from her college (a 2 hour drive away) and everything was all set. The day of the party, one of my roommates was set to go pick Taylor up at her school (she doesn't drive) but she wouldn't reply to her texts or calls. Finally, she replied saying that she was sick and she was sorry she couldn't make it. I was sad but accepted it. Later that night, though, she posted a picture of her all dolled up in front of a mirror, looking as fresh-faced as can be. Eh, it stung a little bit but I knew she must have just felt better and decided to go hang out with friends. I didn't want to hold that against her. I tried to reach out to her and hang out a good number of times in the following months, but she would take days to reply and never seemed like she would follow through. We ended up hanging out once in January of this year over winter break and things were great, but then just back to the texts and late/no replies in the first month of the spring semester.

Then, of course, in February, come the world's CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES... Of course, with the way things are, we haven't seen each other since we've been back home. Regardless, we've been in touch, expressing how much we love and miss each other and how even though we haven't been in touch as much, our friendship is strong and solid and there is nothing to worry about.

Four days ago, now, Taylor asked me if I'd like to go for a walk with her because she missed me and wanted to hang out (and it seemed like a safe way to do so because we can keep a safe distance). I, of COURSE, said yes and that I'd love to do that soon!

The next day, I texted her ""hey there, gorgeous!"" fully intending to solidify our walking plans. No reply from Taylor. That''s fine, I thought, she's got time.

OH HO HO WAS I IN FOR A LIL SURPRISE.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*THIS IS WHERE THE BACKSTORY ENDS AND THE STORY REALLY BEGINS\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

2 days ago I was just relaxing in my room as a quarantined chick does, and I got a notification on my instagram reports app that tells you when people block or unfollow you. Yeah i know, it's dumb but.. shut up don't judge me. Anyway, I got a notification that someone had blocked me. I was a bit confused because usually an unfollow does the trick- blocking is usually reserved for people who have beef. I try to stay as beef-free as I possibly can and I'm pretty damn good at it. Well, lo and behold, Taylor is the one who blocked me.

Immediately, my body went into a fight-or-flight like state. I immediately panicked that I could have done something to upset her?? But even if I had, she'd tell me, right??? We're best friends, right??? My brain just spiraled and I started frantically texting her asking if everything was ok, why did she block me, did I do something wrong, etc...

She replies that she doesn't want me to internalize it, but we ""haven't hung out in like 8 months"" and she's ""minimizing"" her social media.

I replied that I didn't understand why I would be on her list of people she wanted to block, and said I didn't think the temporary distance between us would be enough for her to block me. I reminded her that I tried to reach out to her, I had tried to hang out with her, but we were both busy so it was hard to make that happen. I told her I couldn't make sense of why she did that.

She didn't reply.

I got really upset and said that she's treating me unfairly and that I refuse to accept being treated this way. I said that she's being hurtful and unfair, but to take care of herself. I hit send on the message and...

Message not delivered. She had blocked my phone number.

For the remainder of the day, I was a complete wreck. Crying, sobbing, laying on the floor. I just couldn't understand why she would treat me this way? Why she would throw me aside like garbage after 21 years of being best friends?

Yesterday morning, my mom and I discussed things and we decided that she must have been having some sort of mental breakdown, and I should reach out to her on facebook to offer my support if she needed to talk. I did just that. I told her that even though I'm hurt, I am still here for her and that she can tell me anything and that this isn't like her.

Messages seen. Nickname removed (you can assign nicknames on facebook messenger).

Blocked.

I texted our mutual friend, Riley, as a last-ditch effort to find out what Taylor's problem is. I texted and told her everything that happened, how hurt I was (still am obviously) and how I didn't understand why this was happening.

Riley was shocked when I showed her the screenshots and had absolutely no clue why Taylor would act like this, especially since the two of them had hung out yesterday and Taylor seemed just fine.

Now here I am, still a mess of snot and ugly tears, trying to reconcile this whole thing and feeling more heartbreak than I have from any breakup I've ever had. I want to think that this could all blow over, but Taylor has broken my heart AND my trust and I don't know how we could ever come back from this.

I'll update if anything happens. Thank you for reading, this was therapeutic for me.

TL;DR My best friend of 21 years blocked me on social media out of nowhere and won't tell me why. Three days ago, she had asked me to hang out with her soon and everything was seemingly normal. Now this.

I just need advice and support.",relationships
"My mom constantly whines about every little thing despite the magnitude (yells at me about having a pair of shoes downstairs, my decision to smoke weed in a legal state [it isn't negatively affecting my grades either, I had the best grades I've ever earned last semester], once yelled at me for shaking up orange juice too much, which I am pretty sure isn't a thing).

"I know most people will point out the age difference, and I guess that's valid. Point is, it has not been a bad thing at all. She's a bit mature for her age and I'm a little young at heart for my age and I think we meet somewhere in the middle. Her parents have a 13 year age difference and it is a normal thing for her and we have for the most part gotten on great although her friends have made remarks (nevermind that though). 

She's bi-polar. Not to an extreme degree. She's up, she's down and somewhere in there she's in between- or maybe just managing? The Covid-19 lockdown has her in a low place lately. She's overworked as an essential employee and she works by herself a lot with little more social interaction than me, and I know that is a contributing factor. She can't get out and exercise at all, and I know that was a big mood stabilizer for her. As a result she's gained a little weight and doesn't feel good about herself. 

I've never been one to get held up on physical appearances, but even still she looks great- and I've told her. Nevertheless, we haven't had sex in 3 weeks after usually having sex at least once a week.

It's not about the lack of sex that's bothering me, it's about the lack of connection that's bumming me out.

She misses her family,

She misses exercising,

She is feeling depressed and trapped.

A couple of days ago I helped her build a bunch of planters for her garden, and set up dirt, I made her breakfast and dinner and we had a nice day. That night I was kind of feeling her out to see if she was feeling up to sexy time but she gave me the cold shoulder. I finally asked her (probably stupidly) about what's going on. I asked about the lack of sex but prefaced immediately that I don't care about a dry spell but am more concerned about feeling like we are less connected over the past few weeks and that I'm worried about her. I was just trying to open a conversation about what's going on.

She explained calmly that she feels depressed and explained what I listed above, and I told her I'm not very good at communicating and she said that she isn't either, that I've bombed a few relationships because I didn't know how to talk about problems and she said she has done the same. I told her I knew that there'd be ups and downs and I expressed my lack of experience dating someone who is bi-polar, and if she had any advice for how I could help her feel better and she kind of glumly said, ""I don't know really"" and something to the effect of ""I'll let you know"", thanked me for a nice day and that was that.

I feel like I'm underfoot and I've decided to just give her space. She's not reaching out anymore whereas she usually blew up my phone to chat or invite me over. In that paranoid place in my heart I feel like she's over me, in the rational place I feel like she's in a bad spot and I feel ineffectual to do anything about it while she works out her demons.

"I’ve been seeing a guy for 7 months now, and I’m starting to question whether I’ve had poor judgement and should move on before things get serious. 

As a little background, our relationship began as a “friends with benefits” type of dynamic, but it’s starting to get serious. Although we didn’t settle on being exclusive/monogamous, we have both only been seeing each other, with a few exceptions here and there. That being said, we are pretty loyal and committed since we make each other happy. Considering our age dynamic, I am naturally a bit insecure about the relationship, hence my reasons for not wanting to move forward into a genuine one. He also has his fair share of reasons, such as mental health issues and past trauma. Our relationship has been primarily sexual at the start, but through the last three months, we had started to open up to each other a little more, going on dates and enjoying activities together. We do care about our day to day lives and personal growth, so I wouldn’t label him as a hookup either. Although we don’t see each other frequently—at most two times week—we still have a strong physical and emotional connection that keeps us together. We’ve taken breaks every now and then, though we constantly find ourselves coming back to one another. 

Back to the topic of this post—recently I’ve noticed that he has been sending me pictures of Instagram models through DM. He’d tell me that I should get the lingerie the models are wearing because it would look good on me. The other day he sent a pic of a girl saying that her body was the “perfect body.” I’ve been typically passive about his messages since I also follow attractive models, but it seemed like he was pushing it and comparing me to them. What bothered me the most was the fact that most models were my age (18-21) when he was nearing 30. He’d constantly joke around about me having “Gen Z body with a millennial mind.” I can’t tell whether he is fetishizing the idea of being with younger women, or genuinely appreciates me and not just my body. (For context, I am pretty fit for the most part, though I don’t have a nice bum or big tits like the models.) He also told me that if I posted more pictures, I could become “insta famous” which is never what I’d aspired to be lol. 

I see where he was coming from since he wanted me to wear the lingerie/bikinis for him, but it seems a little objectifying. For the most part he still shows that he cares past the intimacy, but now I am becoming more doubtful. 

I would like to know whether I’ve been blinded by the affection he gives me. He raises so many red flags but I think something had kept me attached. He knows that I can be insecure yet he still sends me things like this and insists that he’s body positive. He never told me to lose weight or workout more so I give him that. 

TL;DR: My partner sends me pictures of attractive models in stripper-esquire lingerie and bikinis telling me wear them. Am I being objectified?",relationships
"So it's a weird situation and unfortunately, almost everyone in our group is interlaced in some way (and anyone who I'm still talking to has heard no end to it, and I would rather save them another earful of the same story).  I'm going to say now, I'm sorry for the super long read.

About two years ago I moved out with my boyfriend, his friend (L), my brother, and a friend of his.  It was a weird situation, as my best friend of 15 years was dating the friend (L), and I met my current boyfriend through them.  Initially, the plan was for her to move out with us, but it never happened.  I was wary of him moving out with us, but our initial 5th fell out two weeks before move-out.  Unfortunately, it went down even worse than I thought.

He was disgusting--brought roaches, didn't clean anything, spattered raw chicken juice on everything.  The house was newly fixed up and the landlords were concerned about the condition of the house because of how poorly he took care of his personal space (in particular, the bathroom).  Initially I tried to ask my friend for advice, but she didn't want to hear it, so (begrudgingly) I stopped bringing it up.

My friend started coming in a lot--not a single time for me, which I can understand wanting to see her boyfriend, but I expressed to her I'd like to see her sometimes too.  The one time she was meant to see me she was late for an hour because she went to see her boyfriend instead of me.  She claims she misunderstood the time, but I think I only had one other talk with her in the several months that followed before it got worse.  This whole time, her boyfriend continued his poor behavior, and started getting volatile after repeated requests to fix the problems he was causing.  He started belittling everyone in the house, harrassing me, repeatedly spam calling/messaging me when he had an issue with the house.  He called the one girl a whore, my brother an idiot/dumbass/etc., called my boyfriend a shitty person and would start complaining how he was a horrible friend, even laughed at a haircut of mine when I was minding my own business--all of this to my face.  I wish I could say I fought back, but I was so depressed I just quietly took all of it without saying much of anything (besides trying to enforce cleanliness rules and deadlines).

At around New Year's last year, he asked me if he could hold a party and invited me (since I lived here), and I let him, because I just wanted to stay on good terms, but declined the invite and admitted I had been too depressed to really want to see anyone.  A few days later I found out the friend had invited all of my mutual friends but avoided asking me to my own house, or even if it was okay.  At this point she had already completed been avoiding me unless she caught me in the kitchen when she was over, and at some point started showering at the house pretty frequently.

About a month later she asked to be let in the house (which she would occasionally do), and I stood my ground and let her know I just couldn't keep letting her in (she would ask to be let in the house when her boyfriend wasn't there, not for me, but to wait for him, or leave gifts for him), and I just wasn't comfortable.  I told her that inviting friends to a party, asking to be let in the house all the time, and showering here so frequently wasn't really okay with me, to which she spat back she thought I was controlling and that things weren't so one-sided.  I was told she called her boyfriend immediately, and he spam called me until I picked up to explain the situation and that in general, she was overstepping her boundaries not just as a guest, but for me as a friend.  The next couple of days we caught her sneaking around the house trying to avoid seeing me at all.

Unfortunately, and this was completely my fault, but I never wrote up a lease agreement for everyone.  I had gotten extremely sick around move-in because of all the stress, and honestly, emotionally I feel like I'm still recovering, almost two-years later.  I feel like a lot of this would have been solved if rules were written out, but everyone here broke the rules that I did give them--frequently, and severely (and in general, these were simple things like, please be clean, and maybe don't have your partner living here, or let us know if you break something that belongs to someone else).  We were all friends, and initially tried to talk through the issues, but the boyfriend and the one girl didn't seem to want to listen to anyone else, and just did what they wanted.  At the end of it all, he went off without paying me the last month of rent, giving me $75 to work with with my recently-unemployed boyfriend, because he claimed he didn't owe me more than the few days he was there.  He didn't have a security deposit, either, so all of that came directly from my pocket.

When confronting my friend a few months later, she told me I was toxic, said she didn't know if I was worth being friends with, and claimed that nobody else has claimed the things I said about her boyfriend.  She stood by his side entirely.  I have been angry for so long, and I'm still trying to figure out what emotions I'm feeling.  I've since gotten back in touch with this friend, more than half a year later, but I'm still furious.  She technically apologized but tried to rationalize everything she did, and I just didn't feel heard.  I've been struggling with the worst depression I've ever had in my life, and even worse, I've been struggling with immense rage.  I want to forgive her, but I can't even figure out why I'm so upset--if it's the lack of integrity on her part, the entitlement and abuse I suffered on his, or just the trauma of the whole situation, if it isn't just something else entirely.  I would like to fix our relationship, but I feel like for that to happen I need the experiences I suffered to be validated from her--that she has to be accountable for what she did, and acknowledge that they both did these things.  I don't think I was entirely in the right either, and their feelings are and were valid, but I don't think that excuses the things that they did, and I'm still struggling with all of it.

TL;DR I'm hurt because I feel betrayed by my once-best friend and have not been able to move past the anger from it (or even figure out why I still feel almost as angry as I did when it was happening)

"I've been shy for much of my childhood and early adolescence. However when I started smoking weed around 16 I started being more and more outgoing until a point where I felt almost charismatic. Nothing dramatic, I always been a ""nerdy"" type, with a mad passion for music, philosophy, cultural stuff, also very much into ""early"" internet culture (in my country at least, Italy, I was into memes and internet friends when these things were not common at all, around 2011/2012). So nothing like the ""cool kid"" at school, actually I was quite an outcast, by choice.   
**But besides that, I never felt socially impaired.**   
Compared to the ""social anxiety"" that's very popular with internet kids, I feel kinda the opposite. I love talking to people and being around them, I love being outside and doing stuff, actually I feel it is very important for my personality/realization.I changed friends every 3 or 4 years during my life, I had three big ""phases"". Right now, I have a girlfriend that I love very much, and 3/4 real friends with whom I often went out (before the pandemic ofc).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You could say I'm lucky and I shouldn't be here asking for help but...I started being very annoyed by a friend which regularly went out with us, that started going more and more against my values. He started being... overly simplistic, proudly coarse, almost like a donkey, really.   
He wasn't like that once. Long story short, I decided to burn bridges with him, and it's difficult because it's very pervasive. Like, he's the only one always pushing for going out and when I told him my problems with his attitude he basically responded he doesn't care.  
This in turn had led me to a lot of questions about my life and talking with my girlfriend it seems like maybe I can't handle relationships as well as I thought. I never talk about deep personal issues with my friends, I'm completely unable to speak about what I don't like about them. I fear confrontation and rejection. My bonds with people are way shallower than I imagined, probably.  
But most of all, lately I realized my girlfriend is the only one I feel truly comfortable partying, traveling, doing the thing's I once did with my friends. Thank god she is there!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

She doesn't feel like my current friends can be hers too, and sadly, she also doesn't have any stable friends. We are almost trying to expand ourselves socially as a couple, is that an awkward thing?**Recently, I have this fear that the world is rejecting me.**   
Everyone seems distant, It looks that I only like people with way less social appetite than me, and that I can't stand the ones that match my energy.Recently I started a new facebook profile where I only add people from the nearby town that i find interesting, but I feel weird about them. I don't really know them, not even one friend in common, and I don't know how to approach them.  
I feel this aura of inaccessibility and haughtiness around them.   
Main thing is that I'm too selective to be thrown around random people because probably I'll not like them, but I never receive any gratification from trying to get outside my world, I never find anyone that looks genuinely happy to have a new friend. Is the world really going in this direction?   
For instance my gf has two friends that I really like, but they feel perceivebly uneasy around new people. Another girl I found from a mutual friend that seems truly my type told us that she doesn't want to meet more than two people at once because she doesn't like it.  
I would love to have a group of friends I can do everything with. I know it's kind of naive and maybe I'm too old for that but I feel weirdly alone, more than ever, and the lockdown has made this worse. **What should I do?**

p.s. I wrote this in a train of thought fashion and English is not my first language, so err, excuse me

**TL;DR** : I feel like being rejected by the world and I don't understand why can't I have a tight group of friends. The whole world seems cold and distant to me, what can I do?",relationships
"We split up approximately 24 months ago, and loved each other very deeply at the time. It was an incredibly hard split because it was caused by mental illness, and during the relationship we had split up multiple times for these reasons and immediately got back together again because we were inseparable and probably codependent. When we split up for good it was because we decided it was better to go our separate ways and to heal with lots of therapy, and we agreed that we wouldn't just fall into each other's arms.

Since out breakup I've done lots of work on myself and have reached my goals and worked on my mental health with lots of therapy, and I've dated other people. Throughout it, I havent stopped thinking of him. We've occasionally had one or two lone messages to say happy birthday or merry Christmas, but he was rightly firm with boundaries because we were still very much healing and messed up. Hes always been on my mind throughout the last 2 years, but I've always busied myself or focused on something else. 

A couple of weeks ago he sent me a couple of messages, and we've been talking since. I've come to realise that the thoughts I've had of him for the past couple of years weren't just what's to be expected, but that I'm still very much in love with him. We've had many conversations over the past fortnight, and we're both happy and well. I miss him deeply and seeing him happy and settled has brought back so many memories for me. We havent slipped back into being overly intimate, we're not codependent, and we've both come a long way separately.

What do I do? He seems far better than he was mentally, and I know I am. Is it meant to be, or am I the only one feeling this way? I'm scared to broach anything in case he doesnt feel the same way - but I'm also well enough to know that I'm good enough on my own and it's okay and understandable if he doesnt want anything more than an occasional conversation with an ex. For what it's worth he's been very tender with me and talks about how special it is to talk.

Asking for advice from more impartial people.

"Ive been with my GF since 2013, and from early in the relationship i told her how my mom is. Most people do get that weird vibe from my mom like there is something off with her. And it is she has schizophrenia.  From young age i was told my father hated me and didn't want me. That aint true found out christmas 2019.  I never realized how bad my life was when i was young, we lived with my grandma and grandpa until he died 01.  Then we lived with mom sister for almost a year.  Then we lived just me and mom in small basement apartment with single bedroom (i slept on a couch in living room) we lived there until 2013. This basement was a pile of trash. Mostly because of me and my mom. Trash everywhere. Rotten food in refrigator. Coca cola bottles everywhere even old food.  I didn't know any better. I started skipping school a lot when i was 14/15.  Because i was always in same clothes or atleast most of the time. I did wash them. During this time 03 until 2013 i was under constant pressure and stress cause my mom was constantly threatening me. Saying she will kill me in my sleep if i didn't bike to the store for her.  That she would starve me to death if i didn't take small loan which was transfered within 10 minutes .  Those loans had huge interest and you had X limit but could take like 10 small in row.  She never paid back and i had no job. When i got my drivers licence 2011 and job (same place as my mom)  things only got worse cause now i had car to drive to store and she asked daily. I couldn't even afford to move out cause all my money went to paying off 1000x debts and taking new ones cause it was like i was brainwashed to do this to help her even thought it had me in bad place financially.  She said that i'm still young so those debts wouldnt matter.  They did. Anyway i'm still working same job but 2017 i moved in with my GF parents. My mom was constantly texting or calling me ask to drive her this and there if i said i couldnt she would say then me and the cat will just starve to death.  It took me long time to figure out how unhealthy it is to be close with her. I told myself once me and my GF have our own place i would go as Low Contact to mom as i could.

I  even told my GF that i would she agreed.  2019 in September. We bought a place. I already blocked my mom everywhere.  Now my GF isn't helping cause she still has my mom on Social Media and still responds to her. Which i hate. Cause i'm trying to not speak with her even thought i bump in her at work sometimes cause we work at same place. Mom has worked here since 1997.  I started 2011. I like this job but i'm trying to find new one but money here is good (i make about 50% more than my mom) and it's good work. Nice boss and all that.    How can i tell my gf to please block my mom like i did. My GF she doesn't want to start drama in my family cause my family members already think my GF is controlling me since i do not go to any events where my mom is. And i probably never will until she is not alive anymore.  One of my cousin is always telling me i need to talk to my mom and if i don't respond she'll text my gf or send her message on FB.   My gf hates it but still responds.    I hate it too cause then my GF will show it to me/ask me or talk to me through either my mom or my cousin. I hate that my GF wont listen and block my mom and it's like she doen't realize hwo bad it hurts me even after telling it to her. Also one of the reason she wont block my mom is because sometimes my mom posts Facebook status. Like something about me/us that we havent invited her to our new house or complains that we never take time to visit my mom. My wants to stick up for her self and respond to my mom. Or to my relatives that stick by mom because she has sickness.  Like when my mom did status last month about never have been to our house and that we never visited her.  One of my cousin just had to comment and say it was not nice of me and my girlfriend that we should make time for my mom and invite my mom to our new house. And ofcourse my Gf had to comment back. Instead of just ignoring it. I don't care what my relatives think. I only actually like just couple of them. Rest of them only just talk about my mom to me and try and tell me to talk to her.  My mom regulary posts statuses like this or similar and many of my relatives will of course stick by my mom site.

**tl;dr** im trying to go Low contact/NC on my mom. But GF isn't helping even when explaining how it affects me. I already have my mom blocked everywhere but my mom will talk through my GF to me.",relationships
"Hey all,

So, first of all of the disclaimers: I followed these girls before we were together or when we were on a break. I did not even interacted with them. I simply like to see, and i honestly do not give a big crap about social media. I could not care less if my gf was following other guys, because i trust her, she would never do anything to harm me. Because I would never do anything to hurt her, such as interacting with other girls.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, she takes a screenshot of a girl I follow on instagram (honestly I did not even remember following that person, as since I have a gf and my instagram is used mostly to look for cat memes and other memes) I get upset, as this is not the first time she did this. Once she asked me why I followed a girl from my work. I hate that she goes and see who I follow, tells me that she does not trust me.  
I told her it was a girl that i probably followed before we met or while we were during a recent breakup we had. She says that If anytime we breakup, i go follow random girls, it means that I only think with my dick.  


A bit of context here guys: we had a big fight a month ago and I had to go through hell to have her back. I sent her flowers to her house, I started putting myself in second place these last days to be there for her, took her for a ride, gave her dinner many times, cooked for her many times.   
Then she decides to do this. I have nothing to hide, as again, I dont try to engage with other girls. But she sees this as act of cheating. And I cannot do anything about. Now she thinks I am a cheater that looks and appreciates other girls and I feel guilty.  


TL;DR: Gf sent me a picture of a girl I follow asking me why I follow and who she is. I told her I probably found her cute and now she says I am looking at other girls and wants to break up with me and does not trust me anymore.",relationships

I recognized this girl from one of our labs in university, and the photo that my partner screenshotted from her VSCO was pretty old so he had to have been scrolling for a while. I later said to him that her picture was on my explore page on Instagram and asked if he recognized her. He said she was from our lab (which I knew) and that she was “hot”. I don’t know how to feel about this, I wasn’t intentionally snooping through his phone trying to find anything, but there have been instances in the past (Years ago) where I found him commenting things on girls Instagram photos like “cutie, what’s your Snapchat?”.

"Well long story short I am currently stuck in Australia and have been since February and am not sure when I'll make it back to my place in London. I decided to move out as I was just wasting so much rent for no purpose, housemates were understanding about this.  I've also been without work or income since February. They didn't want me to get a sublet but the landlords are making them advertise my room for a new housemate, though it will be very difficult to find a replacement.

One of the housemates I'm much closer to and she has been great, I'll call her K, the other one was always difficult to live with and very moody, she can be A. I still have all my things over there which K said she could pack up and store in her room. A hasn't mentioned helping, but has suggested I get another friend over to help. This friend isn't exactly comfortable having to get lots of public transport to get to my place, especially as both my housemates are nurses, but will do it if really needed.

In regards to the bills, A sent a message a couple of weeks ago saying it's only fair that I still pay bills for that month. I didn't completely agree, sure I can pay the set bills but I'm not using any electricity or water.
I said I'd pay just to keep the peace and knowing they have all my things it's much easier just to pay. A did say that next month (May) would obviously be a different story as I'll be officially moved out then.

I've now noticed that A has added May bills and included me in these. None of this has been communicated with me at all and I'm confused since I'll technically be moved out on the 16th and her previous message made it sound like I won't have to this month.

I messaged the girls asking to get together for a chat so we can sort this out. We are going to chat on Friday but they wanted to know what it was about. I just said I was confused about the bills. K seemed to have added the same bill a couple of times and I'm mostly confused about this month's bills. 

A's only response was that I'm paying the same bills as K. K is much more empathetic. I explained that I assumed I wouldn't be paying bills after I move out, am happy to pay up until the 16th though. Again, it's tricky because they have my things so I don't want to cause conflict. Ended up just saying we'll talk about it on Friday. 

I just want to get some advice before our chat on Friday as I feel it'll be very them against me. They've had plenty of notice of me moving out and they also know my financial situation. I'm also aware that it puts them in a difficult situation but what if they don't find someone? Which is most likely going to happen, do I just keep paying bills even though I won't be paying rent?

Tldr; I've had to move out of my flat due to being stuck in another country without work for months. Housemates are still making me pay bills but they still have my things.",relationships
"I’m at a loss of how to help him and perhaps need a different perspective. 

My brother (15M) wasn’t always like this. When he was younger, he was able to talk to others without a hitch and could even make friends easily (or more easily than now). Over the last four or so years, he’s gotten more and more reclusive and hides away in his room unable to talk to others besides our immediate family. He dreads presentations at school, hides away in the library at lunch to avoid talking to/being around others, can’t order things he needs whether it’s food or talking to a cashier, etc. He is unable to ask questions in his classes to his teachers and his grades aren’t that great. 

The most alarming signs are that he seeks food as a comfort to the point where he’s overweight now and he tried to self harm by cutting himself around last year but I thankfully caught it in the early stages and he’s since stopped. He’s turned to video games as well and barely speaks to us. It’s incredibly difficult for him to open up and share his feelings and I’m worried most about that aspect. I’m the closest to him and yet it’s like pulling nails to get him to tell me what’s wrong and that he’d rather keep it all to himself. 

I’ve tried to intervene and help him by taking him on a shopping spree to make him feel better about himself and spend time with him everyday so he knows he has someone who he can always come to for anything. I’ve taken him to my therapist (more like forced him to come with me) and he opened up but isn’t all that keen on going back and continuing. I’ve tried to get him to do activities with me so he’d get some exercise in because I know if he’d get moving, he’d feel a whole lot better in general. He refuses and won’t come along with me so I’m really at a loss about this issue. Our parents swear nothing is wrong even though there’s clearly an issue and I’m afraid if he continues like this, it’ll take a lot longer to correct. I don’t want him to get bullied or hurt because of this; he has a soft heart and it would destroy me. 

What are some things I can do to help him? Everything I’ve tried hasn’t really come to fruition but I don’t want to give up.

The quarantine has been draining my motivation to do anything and it’s been hard to keep up at her pace. She’s always calling me “dry” when I’m not saying anything.

"So my girlfriend of 3 years has recently said that she still loves me but that the 'spark' has gone, so she's not in love with me. She's had this feeling for around 3 months apparently, after she started proposing the idea of getting married and having kids (which I was on board with), in those 3 months I thought everything was going well. We've been living together for nearly 2 years, just signed an extension on the rent in our current house, we were meant to be off on holiday next week (which she booked in January, but due to coronavirus, we obviously can't). 

We needed some time apart from each other and she's seemingly enjoying it, which is fair enough. I've tried finding out what could of been the reason(s), but she can't seem to give me one, it's always 'there's nothing wrong with you, I'm just not in love with you', or 'if you're gonna look for reasons, you'll look forever'. The insecure part of me feels like there's someone else, but I brought this up &amp; she denied it. I can't wrap my head around it.

We're not even sleeping in the same room anymore, I don't know what to do, I love her more than anything &amp; I'd do anything to get that spark back but how the hell do I that?

However, the last year or so with my (22M) current girlfriend of 4 years (21F) I have had a dramatic decrease in desire for her as well as an increase in dissatisfaction for us being together.  Ever since the beginning of our relationship when I learned my partner (21F) has trouble orgasming solely from vaginal intercourse, I have performed oral sex on her 90% of the time when we have sex in order for her to orgasm.  However, as of the last year I have expressed to my desires for us to mature a little bit in the bedroom; nothing specific I mostly wanted to hear what she might be interested in trying as I’m pretty much down for anything that isn’t sticking things up my own butt, and we have found several things we both find fun that are new.  One of these being using a vibrator during intercourse, and this is the only other sure way I’ve found to make sure she gets off if she wants too.  


The problem is that she is an extremely lazy lover and barely ever puts in effort to our sex and instead mostly just lays there; this manifests as her expecting me to take responsibility for making sure her and I are satisfied.  Don’t get me wrong I’m usually more than happy to “fill” this role, but as I get older I have presented to her that I would like more effort reciprocated in our romance, and would like to myself be treated sometimes; she then attacks me with arguments about how I’m saying she isn’t enough (which I’m not) and then says hyperbolic statements over-generalizing the things I say.  And if there’s a time (like today) when I work 8 hours of manual labor and get home late and she’s tryina get sexy but I don’t really feel like performing oral sex sex, and instead offer using the vibrator with our intercourse, she then attacks me saying that I don’t make her feel sexy and that I can’t make her wet as well as giving me the ultimatum I have to eat her out if I wanna have sex.


Idk what to do I’ve tried researching psychological/anatomical solutions or remedies, as well as having rational conversation with her about it dozens of times, but to no avail.  I love her to the moon and back and I really do a lot for her, but being sexual content is a big deal for me in a mature relationship as these problems spill over to other arenas of our relationship.  


What can I do/what can I say?  If I haven’t been able to gain any ground in a year, how long should I keep trying?  Any advice or perspective is appreciated, thank you.


tl;dr - I don’t know how to mitigate my (22M) girlfriend of over 4 years’ (21F) laziness and selfishness towards our sex life and nothing seems to work at solving the problem, Where do I go from here?",relationships
"So some background, we are both gay. We worked together for a few years and have bonded a lot. He’s given me advice and sort of taken me under his wing as I had a lot of insecurities when I first met him and have grown up a lot in that time. We would see each other at work every week and talk about all kinds of things. We’ve gotten pretty close and were going to get coffee as friends but hadn’t had a chance. 


After the quarantine we exchanged numbers on Facebook to keep up and  other than a few comments here and there on posts, hadn’t spoke since.


6 weeks later I get a text from him at 3am telling me how much he missed seeing and talking to me. Prior to this I was planning to text him but wasn’t sure if he’d want to hear from me. It really caught me off guard and was pretty unlike him. I responded the next morning asking him how he was and that I missed talking to him but it’s been over a week and no response. 


My assumption is he drunk texted me, and got embarrassed. Maybe I’m wrong but it seems likely. 


Anyway, I really have had him on my mind a lot lately because at times I figured I was always a bit more fond of him, but now I think he may feel the same about me. I still don’t like him in a romantic way, but I’m missing our talks a lot more now if he seems to have enjoyed my company equally. 


I’m not sure if I should send him another text or just leave it all and let him decide what to do. If I do reply again, I’m not sure if I should ignore what he said and change the subject to a common interest or what. My last text to him was a question. Since we never called or texted before it is complicated to start using that form of communication suddenly. I’m not going back to that job so this is the only way we’ll be able to talk for now. Just worried he’ll never respond since it’s going on two weeks now. 


TL;DR
Good friend drunk texted me in the middle of the night and has ghosted me ever since I replied. Up until then we talked weekly in person. Now I am wondering if I should send him another message or just ignore it.",relationships
"I am dating someone I know my father does not like. She and I started as friends and after meeting her for the first time my father vehemently and blatantly expressed his disgust towards her. It was clear that his objections were founded in deep seated prejudices he holds.

My GF and I have been dating for over a year. All of our friends and most of my family know her and like her, none of them share any of my fathers opinions. My father is the only person who does not know that I am in a relationship, I want to tell him but I'm apprehensive about how he would react. He has a volatile temper and tends to linger on things that make him upset, making life hellish for everyone around him. I don't want to ruin my relationship with my dad but I'm more worried that he will vent all of his frustration towards the rest of my family. What is the best way to approach this situation? I have to tell my father something he really does not want to hear. 

TL;DR - Need to tell my hostile faster about a relationship I know he will disprove of.",relationships
"It’s been a year since he broke up with me, after we had dated a little over two years and were living together. He realized quickly after that he made a mistake. We spent the summer “working on things” but nothing was really changing. He still wasn’t sure how he felt. I was miserable at my job and felt stuck and restless in life in general. I applied for a job in California, after asking what he thought about the prospect and him basically saying he didn’t want to stand in my way of a great opportunity.

After I got the job, he said he didn’t want me to go. I said it was too late. I made the move with a “let’s see where this takes me” attitude, without writing off the possibility that we’d still end up together once we’d worked on ourselves. The job was going to be a great springboard for my career.

Flash forward 7 months and even though I love the state, I don’t like my job. He’s been going to therapy and we’ve been making huge strides. We each made a trip to visit the other in that time with mostly good results. Pre-Coronavirus, I was already doubting whether or not I wanted to stay here past 2020.

Two months into quarantine and he is really struggling. He’s been pushing me for weeks to come hunker down with him but there were a number of hurdles for me. He lives alone and has more equipment he needs to work from home than I do (and I have a roommate), so him coming HERE is not on the table. He’s reached a breaking point and is now telling me that, if I don’t fly out to see him (I can do two weeks max), that he “needs to move on”. After 3 years, he seems to think these two weeks will give him enough information to decide once and for all that he’s ready to go all in. 

I’m not a crazy anxiety riddled mess about COVID but I believe it’s extremely serious and it’s on every one of us to look out for the healthy of our communities, even when we ourselves are not at serious risk. I’ve actually been in an OK headspace about this whole thing, despite how serious it is. Thinking about flying makes me very nervous and I would feel like a selfish hypocrite, after strictly following stay at home orders for the last two months.

In the past, some of my more generalized anxiety has led to inaction on my part. Nothing out of the ordinary. But he sees this as just another case of my anxiety getting in the way and I’ve tried to tell him that this IS NOT NORMAL. Everyone is handling this very unprecedented situation in different ways and they’re all valid (except the idiots who don’t even think it’s real obvs). I’ve made a lot of strides in addressing my mindset and my anxiety induced inaction in general (and ummm I moved across the country without knowing a single soul so I think that’s pretty freaking brave), but he just can’t see this is different. I feel completely backed into a corner and unheard.

I don’t even know what I’m asking but I feel like a crazy person here. When I talk to him and he shares his feelings with me, I feel like I want to go. But if he’s putting too much pressure on me or I see some tweet or article, I get scared again. So I keep going back and forth and I just want to resolve this loop we’re stuck in - or at least feel validated!

I really do love him. I wanted to marry him, and I still believe in “us”. He does too, but the position he’s put me in feels very unfair.

Tl;dr - my ex bf and I have been working on ourselves and our relationship on opposite sides of the country for the last 7 months. He’s at a breaking point all of a sudden and demanding I fly out to see him for two weeks so we can decide on our fate as a couple, despite my fear of flying during a global pandemic.",relationships
"My first love; I’m not his.

We dated for a few months. He was my first kiss, treated me well, he had bad family issues and would stay out in the cold to talk to me on the phone (I didn’t know this at the time). I was absolutely in love, he was romantic and passionate and I was naive and inexperienced. 

He broke my heart and then went off to college. We still talk as friends occasionally, but he had got to know I’m obviously still in love with him. He drunk texted me a few weeks ago and we texted more than we ever do. He blames not texting me back on his adhd. But then he says he has to go before he makes any regrets, then says he’s thinking about f***ing me, but he can’t Bc he has a girlfriend (I knew he had one months ago but assumed they had ended things- we don’t speak much)

Very hot and cold with me over the last year. Then he visits home, randomly invites me to get donuts. I lie and say I can’t because I’m watching mama Mia 2. He has a girlfriend and I’m not a home wrecker. 

Tonight he randomly apologizes for hurting me; then goes on a long tangent about his first love and how hard it was to get over them, alluding to me feeling the same way, which I do. But I said I didn’t, because at this point he just uses me for an ego boost. He doesn’t accept my answer and says “trust me it’ll get better”. I casually bring up our old phone calls and how long they were and he says “that’s just something I do when I want something. Even if I don’t like it lol” 

I haven’t responded to that. I don’t like who he is; my family say this is emotional abuse because I stick around because of empathy and tiny fragments of validation and care, just for him to switch into an a**hole. What does all of this mean? I’m new to this.

Tl;dr: he gives me so many mixed signals, it’s been over a year and I can’t heal. Manipulation or just a dumb boy? What does he mean by these signals?",relationships
"TL;DR

Husband made a comment about how me being a working mom would mean he is a 'full-time mom' for watching our future children during the week. 

Hi everyone!

My husband and I are recently married and hoping to wait a little while (3-5 years) before having children.

I used to 100% want to be a Stay-At-Home Mom, but now, I am not so sure. In both my family and my husband’s family, the majority of the women are SAHMs, so it was what I was used to. Over the last few years, I have considered more and more being a working mom.

The main reason is our financial situation. My husband and I make close to the same salary, though he does make around $5K/year more. Because of it being so close, me being a Stay-At-Home Mom would mean a \~50% reduction in our salaries. We could \*technically\* afford it; however, it would mean giving up a nicer house, vacations, hobbies, eating out, etc..

I work a typical 8 AM-5 PM office job that does not have flexible hours.

My husband works 2nd shift now, but he has the option to switch to 3rd, weekend days, and weekend nights. We have discussed him switching to weekend days once we have children.

Okay, now the point of this post.

Yesterday, we were talking about our future plans for when we have children. I expressed that I think it would be beneficial for me to be a working mom, and I started explaining the different options for our children: my husband switching shifts and watching the children, traditional daycare, and paying our moms for daycare.

He mentioned that if I worked, he would assume that he would be watching the children all day during the week. Okay, no problem. He then makes a comment about how he would be the 'full-time mom' and I would be the 'part-time mom'. I immediately shut him down with 'no, you would be a full-time dad and I would be a full-time mom.' He didn't say anything after that.

I felt that his comment was honestly very rude, and I am not sure what to do from here... Jesh, thinking about it now, I wish I said 'sorry, I guess your salary isn't high enough to warrant me to be a full-time mom'.

Is there any way to get him to see that his comment was uncalled for?",relationships
"so since the start of quarantine (for where i’m from it was around mid march, so almost for 2 months) i (19F) barely see my boyfriend (19M) or even talk to him. it all started when my mom came back from a vacation in mexico right before it started getting bad in NJ. my boyfriends mom got very mad that he went with me to the airport to pick her up (we didn’t even leave the car) bc of corona, so she forbid him from seeing me what we assumed would be for 2 weeks. after 2 weeks of me not going anywhere, he finally asked his mom to see me again and she said “you can go on walks with her, but can’t go inside her house and no touching or kissing.” so at first i was like “cant you just lie to her” and he said that he didn’t want to “disappoint her” or feel guilty. but then he would hold my hand and kiss me on our walks??? but still couldnt come inside my house?? but he can still go to work at his job at the garden center where he didn’t wear a mask until 2 weeks ago?? and so this went on for a while until we got into a fight because he got mad at me for insisting to talk to his mom and i said then don’t touch or kiss me anymore if you want to listen to her so badly and he said ok. time went on during quarantine and we would maybe go on 3-4 walks during the week for like 20 min only bc we are both busy with school and work. now more recently i havent seen him in over 5 days and we haven’t facetimed or texted (except for goodmorning). i feel like i’m not even in a relationship anymore because of covid and his mother. she angers me so much with her logic and i don’t understand my boyfriend is picking and choosing which of her rules he wants to follow. any advice?

TL;DR my boyfriend and his mom’s rules don’t make any sense and i feel like we have become distant since quarantine",relationships
"

Hey guys 
I want to start off by saying that she had been the one who was interested in me. She’s 17 and I’m 18 and we happened to be in the same class and had to do a project together. After hanging out for the project I offered her to stay longer and she wanted to. Long story short we started dating and are coupled for like 4 months now. 
But things seem to look a little fishy to me and I start to feel anxious and uncomfortable with the relationship.

Because she always tells me that I don’t listen to her. For example just yesterday we talked about her car for like 30 minutes on the phone. Then after a little pause I asked her if she wanted to start a new series with me on Netflix and she said that she’s not going to answer to that question before I answered. Then I asked what question she asked assuming I overheard it and she told me that I don’t listen to her and she doesn’t want to repeat herself ( this tends to happen very often ). Everything I say could lead to her being in a bad mood and thus causing me to feel guilt. She also has a toxic friend with whom she hangs out and talks with a lot. 
She doesn’t like me and tells my gf to break up with me and go cheat with her in a threesome. My gf declined that but she doesn’t really see why I’m bothered by the fact she got offered to cheat on me. Also yesterday there was this guy in her insta direct she told me (a guy she had sex with) I wasn’t bothered because it was a bug  but she also sent it to her friend and she said 
Maybe you should call him 
Like tf and my gf thinks it’s funny when in reality I just get hurt by it. After that she told me about all the guys she got hit on on instagram and sent me her dms and shit.  I told her confedentially „wow I can be really proud of myself that I got you without hitting on you“ and she just said nothing. She also has the urge to go party after corona is over. Or how she likes to say it: I want to go there and there I miss it. It’s clubbing and she could go. But she also told me how many guys hit on her at the clubs and spend drinks for her and how guys try to dance with her. The fact that she told me she doesn’t want me to go with her makes me uncomfortable aswell. She told me she doesn’t want me to get jealous. I didn’t tell her she shouldnt go but she said: you won’t forbid me this. With the attitude of idgaf what you think. Everything is my fault and I always have to apologize. Also she stays at my house like 3 nights but then wants to stay home for a week. Like okay but I wanna spend time with you. When she comes over she always spends the night with me. She told me she needs her space and I respect that but after a week or so I want to see her again and she says I’m pushing her too much and she doesn’t feel comfortable when I ask when we see eachother again. It’s like we always spend time when she wants but not when I want. Another example me and a friend drive while she is in the back with her friend. All of a sudden her friend starts saying doesn’t a big dick hurt in your vagina, and my gf says I got a story to tell you. Then she whispers in her ear. And both laugh. I turn my head with a smile and she says turn around it’s not about you. We FaceTime every night and she is kind of disrespectful. She can be. She is out of FaceTime and after some time I say: come back to FaceTime I wanna see you, and she just reply’s „nah“ but when I’m doing that she says ok I can hang up then. Or when I say I want to hang up she says that i want to get lose of her. But when she wants to hang up it’s perfectly fine for me. 
I’d really appreciate some mental help guys she hasn’t been like this all the time. And i know she had troubled relationships before.
Edit:
May I also say that she talks about other guys a lot and says omg they’re so funny i like them a lot. And just yesterday she told they all drool when they see her and shit like that like cmon bro makes me uncomfortable.

TL;DR

Gf is always blaming on me and tells me about other guys maybe to hurt me.",relationships
"I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting

My girlfriend and I (let's call her K) have been dating since late March, and it's been a little rocky from the start.

We are in a quarantined state so rarely get to see each other (occasionally we will go shopping for our respective households at the same time and same store), and I feel like it's put a fair amount of strain on a new relationship.

Lately we've been in a long and drawn out argument, she's been frustrated with me because I haven't been taking great care of myself during quarantine, and she feels like she can't talk to me about certain subjects because in the past I've ""shut her down"" when she tried to talk about them.

I admit I've done a poor job at self care lately and thats on me, but I've never intentionally shut her down on any subject and when I asked her about it she said I just seemed ""like I really didn't want to talk about it""

I've been frustrated with her because I everytime our argument starts to escalate she has to ""take the day"" to cool down, so instead of us taking a deep breath, collecting our thoughts and trying to calmly hash it out, we just push it to the next day,, if it starts to escalate we push it to the next day, and the next day, and the next day. What we could've fixed in a day or two has lead to two weeks of combative dialog between us.

Anytime we DO manage to talk it out some and I ask her what her opinion is on something, or if she has ideas how we could fix this problem, communicate better etc etc, anything, all she does is say ""I don't know""  I don't expect her to have all the answers, but at least make an effort right?

Recently K sent me a couple of texts one saying she doesn't even feel like we are in a relationship and another saying she's real close to throwing in the towel.

Maybe I'm too stubborn for my own good but I'm trying my best to work things out. I dont want her to be the one who got away.

TLDR; girlfriend and I have been arguing for a while now and the relationship is strained, shes thinking about throwing in the towel.",relationships
"Hi all,

I was wondering if any of you have been in a similar situation, and what you did about it/what worked/what didn't. I'm extremely concerned with my boyfriend's financial status and how it has affected/will affect our relationship. I've marked everything that seems like a red flag with an \*.

My boyfriend moved in with me in January of 2019. We had been dating less than a year, and he was moving from his parents house to mine (\*). He was/still is pretty dependent on his parents - I guess he uses a credit card that his mom pays for (\*) and has borrowed his dad's truck for months and months (\*) after not getting his own car fixed (\*). When he first moved in, he was student teaching and not getting any income, so I didn't worry too much about him contributing to the mortgage and bills (obviously I have to pay those anyway, so I guess I didn't think about it much). Anytime I wanted to sit down and talk through a budget with him, he got really uncomfortable and would avoid it at all costs (\*).

Over the summer, he didn't get a teaching job. I was up his butt all the time about getting a different kind of job, with the emphasis being that he needed to be a real adult and contribute to the household, which he was very defensive about (\*). He finally got a teaching job just a few days before the school year, and a few days before my mom died of cancer. 

I had a really rough time after my mom died, and I'm sure I was extremely difficult to take care of. I will always be grateful to him for being there for me during that time. 

However, it never even occurred to him to ask if he should be helping out with the mortgage or with bills (\*). The one thing he paid was the internet bill, which was late every single month (\*), and he had to pay a reconnection fee I don't know how many times. It really stressed me out because the account was in my name and I didn't want it to hurt my credit score. Why was the account in my name? Because his credit score was so trashed (\*) we wouldn't have been able to get the internet using his name, so we had to get it under mine. 

We had a very terse talk sometime in March where I told him to get his act together about his car, and that we shouldn't be taking the use of his dad's truck for granted, as it was probably presenting a hardship to his dad. He got defensive again (\*) and said his parents wanted to support him. The conversation, like any other talk we had about money, was incredibly awkward, and he was really shut down. 

A while after that, I told him he absolutely had to start contributing to the household or I couldn't take it anymore. I told him I was sick of supporting both of us and barely making it to my next paycheck while he was able to sail on by month to month. He said he never even thought about it (\*\*\*!!!). I told him he was being immature, and just because he floated by mostly on his parents' dime (the only time he rented a place, they paid for it (\*), otherwise he lived in a dorm or with them) didn't mean I was going to step into a parental role for him. He very defensively asked if I wanted him to clean out his bank account (\*), and very aggressively said stuff like ""I'll write the check right now, what do you want from me,"" that kind of thing. 

He finally, finally, wrote me a check which covered his costs for one month (half the mortgage and half the bills). I made a spreadsheet after that delineating all the months he hadn't paid his half of the mortgage or bills. I was very thorough, and I thought, very fair. He broke down and asked if I wanted him to leave, and if I was going to give him a chance to fix it, and after I tearfully said I wasn't sure if I could get over the fact that he ""didn't think about it"" for 7 months wrote me another check, this time covering a significant amount of what he owes. I swear I wasn't trying to manipulate at all, this is just honestly what happened. 

During this time, he also borrowed my car for work daily (\*) and didn't even thank me, leaving me to drive his dad's truck where the door didn't latch, and I eventually had to get it fixed myself since he didn't. He also got multiple speeding tickets in my car (\*), causing my insurance rates to go up. One speeding ticket he got in November, and he just paid it a few days ago (\*) after me nagging him for months. I'm also really not sure if he's ever paid taxes, as his mom somehow still claims him as a dependent (\*) (and she pays his health insurance for him (\*)).

I come from a family that really stresses independence, so all of these flags really bother me a lot. It blows my mind how someone can be so dependent on their parents and so thoughtless about their financial impacts on another person.

So my questions, those of you who have made it this far, are these:

Am I being a total jerk about this? Am I being money-grubbing?

Have any of you experienced a financially thoughtless person like this and did they change?

Did I just miss a thousand red flags?

Am I just being super ungrateful? He has otherwise been a good partner.

"Saw my boyfriend tonight, and when I got home, he broke up with me. Should I reply to his text?

Hi all. We are 25, and met at work. Known one another for a year and he asked me to be his official girlfriend last Thursday. 

Tonight I saw him for the first time in 3 weeks due to me being in and out of the hospital with an esophageal ulcer. He also had his best friend in town for the last week. 

I went to his house tonight and we have been arguing about things all week. Like us not seeing one another, (due to me being sick) and me feeling like he hasn’t been listening to my feelings and being insensitive. 

We have not been intimate this past year because he told me he has hsv2, (genital herpes) that he got from his ex who cheated on him. 

Once he told me this, which was 3 months in of us knowing one another, i was thankful he told me before anything sexual happened between us and also felt bad for him. Takes courage to say something like that and not everyone is honest about stds. 

During this past year, all our arguments have stemmed from not being sexually intimate (due to std) (also my
Condition as well) and him questioning why. I told him once I found out, that I still was interested in him, and wanted to learn more info for the both of us, and for my own health as well. (I have Vaginismus, so sex is already painful for me). He was tired of being denied all the time he tried initiating sex. 

Tonight after leaving his house, I called him and he asked me again, why haven’t we had sex. I started crying, and told him that I’m not the most comfortable with it all right now. 

He hung up on me. Then texted me this: 

Don’t take this the wrong way, but I’m done hearing you talk. All you say are lies.. you’ve lied about this particular subject over 200 times.. after I’ve told you it’s not fair to lie to me about it. You say you were too worried to lose me. Thanks so much for lying and worrying about your goddamn self.  I hope your new job is great and you have a wonderful life and career.  I’ll always have love for you, and we will always have a connection.. but we will not see each other again 

Should I reply? Or leave it be?

Thanks for any insight. I feel like a shit person.

TLDR; boyfriend and I knew one another for a year. Recently became official. He broke up with me because we haven’t been intimate due to his genital herpes. I wasn’t upfront as I should have been, and now since he knows my true feelings towards his std, he doesn’t want to be with me. Do I reply to text or leave it be?",relationships
"Thank you in advance for reading this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I seriously don’t know what to do or think of the situation. 

TL;DR ever since we went long distance we didn’t seem to understand each very well and went about expressing our feelings in a toxic way. Everything was always negative and we were constantly fighting. 

I’m not really sure where to start. We’ve been together for 3 months. For the first month and a half we were together physically but then he got stationed elsewhere to finish up training. I’m eventually supposed to go to the same place as we both have the same mos. anyways, when we were together everything was perfect and felt so great. When he moved and we became long distance things started changing. We started fighting often, probably like 2-4 times a week. They were always over misunderstandings. 

He would name call me as a joke and I didn’t like that but he always claimed I was being too sensitive and that he obviously didn’t mean it. He eventually stopped after all the nagging I did. But he did express how he felt like he couldn’t even talk to me without me taking it personal and getting all teary eyed. Maybe I am way too over sensitive.. He would also diss anything that I liked that he didn’t agree with. Even if they weren’t meant to be hurtful I took a bit personal. I understand we don’t have to like the same things but doesn’t mean you have to trash it. We would get into a lot of fights over me simply just wanting to let him know how I felt, not even me trying to argue. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, he finally started class. Our schedules are completely different. I’m on night shift and he’s on day shift. I literally start class the time he gets out. So communicating became very difficult. I started waking up super early just so I could talk to him before he went to class. At most we only talked twice a day and for like 20 minutes tops. Maybe I should have been more grateful but I wanted more and I wanted to feel closer to him. I would express this to him and leave him text messages throughout the day saying stuff like “I hate the distance. I feel so disconnected from you. I miss you a bunch and I barely get to talk to you.” I didn’t realize it then but he pointed out to me how shitty those texts made him feel because he felt like he was giving up every free minute he could to talk to me and that I made him feel like he wasn’t doing enough. I realized then that my texts were somewhat toxic. I just wanted him to reassure me that things were going to be okay. He would tell me to stay strong and wait till the weekend. I would and then the weekend comes and we barely talk! Or whenever we do talk it’s never one on one, he’s either doing something or hanging out with his friends so I don’t get his undivided attention. I literally just wanted his attention and his love.. 

Which leads to this past weekend. Same thing. He said he would call me later on before he went to bed so we could talk more personally. But when he called, it was just to tell me goodnight and that he loves me. I got really sad and he could hear it in my voice and it made him frustrated. He got angry at me because he felt like I wasn’t appreciating his efforts and that it’s always about my feelings but never about his and that I’m always whining about something. And this is probably true. I still can’t tell. I know I wasn’t as good of a girlfriend as I could be. I think we both just handled things wrong whenever an issue popped up. 

But yeah he went off on a tangent and I tried to tell him that I do appreciate him and that he is enough for me, but that I just want to feel closer to him by talking to him. And he just kept saying I didn’t understand what he was saying. And truthfully I don’t. Whenever I try to understand what I did wrong, no matter what I say it just comes off as a excuse to him... so I just hung up on him because he kept saying that and just going off on me. That’s when he texted me that he was done with everything and done with me. How I always make him feel like shit and that I’m inconsiderate of his feelings. I took that as him wanting to break up so I told him that if I make him so unhappy that maybe we should just break up. He went on this long tangent about how he’s tired of giving himself up for others and how unhappy he is, especially with the lockdown. He told me it wasn’t all my fault but that I wasn’t helping either. Then he officially broke things off. 

I realized then that I fucked up really bad and tried to apologize and tell him how I didn’t mean anything I said about breaking up that I was just hurt. And he just me that my apologizes mean nothing and that I brought the breakup upon myself. And that he told me that he deleted all of our pictures together right after the phone call. 

We talked today, he reached out to me. I had a big test today and he kept wishing me the best and telling me I was going to do great. We talked on the phone for a bit and I tried again to apologize but it winded up just getting him all frustrated. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure if I should take this as a sign and just move on or try to do some serious self reflection and figure out what he was talking about and try to make things work.",relationships
"We've known each other for almost 8 years and have dated a couple of years 'officially' a few years ago.

For the past few years we've been friends but more than that as well, just without a title.

Every time we talk and try to find a way to further our relationship to something more, a kind of cycle happens where things just seem to fall apart. We aren't a toxic couple or anything, we don't fight other than the usually small things that get we get over within an hour or so. We love each other and actively call each other our soul mates.

As things get more serious, as I said, a kind of cycle happens where something happens with one of us that puts the other off from wanting to move it forward. I'll just talk about the latest case of this cycle which is mostly to blame on me.

She started to get super into me, and the thought of us, and at the same time I got hit with a pretty big bout of depression. I dont have many friends and growing up I never talked about my problems and kept them to myself, and tried dealing with it myself. During this depression I just cloistered up and became unsociable and tired. Id try to make attempts to hang out with her and keep things moving but this mental state of mind just weighed on me like nothing I've really felt before and I didn't know what to do.

Later, she told me she didn't like the person I was and that it was like a switch just flipped in me, and a little later cut off contact. A month later we returned to talking, and in that month I really tried to pull myself out of it and find ways to improve myself, and I told her I'd be more open and include her in my problems and try to get through anything together rather than me just shelling up.

I asked her recently if she thought there was still a future for us and she said she doesn't think so, since she'll always be wondering if that 'flip of a switch' will happen again. I told her it wasn't a case of will it happen, but more of when it does happen I want to include her in helping me thru it as I help her thru whatever she's got going on.

I guess I just don't know what to do, because I really do love her and see us as end game material.

Tl;dr: when things get serious between us something happens that puts the other off of wanting to take it further. This current cycle is my fault due to mental issues and depression and not involving her in my problems. Spent time trying to work on myself and rectifying it. She doesn't see us together because she's afraid ill go back to that and idk how to communicate or assure to her that its not a case of 'if' but 'when' and when it happens I want to make sure she's apart of the process in being there for me vs me trying to deal on my own.",relationships
"I'm a 22 years old guy with no siblings, my mother passed away when I was 17 and after living alone for a year, I had to move back in with my father who's in his 50s and that's how it's been since then, just me and him. My father and I are very different people, polar opposites in fact, but my father is frustratingly clingy. I can tell he doesn't like my personality, and has been a obstacle to me doing what I wanted to do in life (a musician or a boxer) because it conflicted with his idea of a successful respectable man. Basically he wishes I was like him, and places all this on my head because he wouldn't have more children, always trying to change my whole character because I'm his only son and I didn't turn out to be like him. Now all my life I obeyed him like a pet out of respect for him raising me and because he is my father and he is a very caring one too, despite the fact that his overprotectiveness in my childhood as well as keeping me without siblings has had a completely detrimental effect on my communication and relationship skills as an adult, all in hopes that one day he'd accept that I've become a man and let me go out and live my own life, but ever since my mother passed away he refuses to remarry and isolates himself socially from even his own friends (he rarely sees his ""friends"" except maybe once every month or less), and constantly tries to ""raise"" me as a child because it looks like that's the only social contact he has in his daily life. All he's done in the past few years besides mourning is get more and more naggy and possessive on me. I told him why wont he remarry and have more children, or adopt more children, but he just refuses and wants to stay socially isolated while burdening me with his emotions and making me feel like I'm a lesser man for not being more like him. Instead he wants me to hand over my future kids to him to raise, basically that's his solution. As much as I respect his efforts in raising me, the man does not know how to raise children, exemplified by how I turned out. His reasoning for not having more children was that I was too much of a burden on him (he stressed my personality being the culprit of this) and more children would have been too hard on him, but I know for a fact that I obeyed him perfectly until the age of 16 and being an only child, he should not have any excuse for having me turn out so socially, ummmm, different I guess from everyone else (I know this is his fault as he told me exactly why he kept me so isolated in my childhood and wouldn't let me go outside), so obviously there is no way he's raising my children for me. I dont hate him, but he's just becoming an obstacle to me getting further in life but at the same time I genuinely want to repay him for raising me anyway, he's still my father no matter what and I do sympathize with his situation with the loss of his wife and lack of friends. I'm just totally confused on how to be able to live my life and be my own man while keeping him happy.

tl;dr
My father who is the opposite of me is lonely and wants me to deal with his loneliness for him even when he knows how to cure himself of it while I'm trying to build my future that he is interfering with.",relationships
"I can’t link the original post but it’s on my profile if you’re interested to get some background. 

Ex-FWB of 8 months, on and off. Him and I fooled around while I was ovulating without a condom. It was two weeks before my period. I told him everything should be okay because we didn’t have sex so he never ejaculate inside of me (TMI) but he was worried anyway. We agreed to go no contact because he told me he isn’t ready for a relationship and I wasn’t willing to settle for anything less. I told him I would let him know if I missed my period or I would just ‘like’ one of our messages if I got my period — I just wasn’t interested in conversing with him because I didn’t want to get back into the same cycle of meeting up with him. 

Two weeks passed and I got my period. He never reached out to me so I was assuming he forgot. He messaged me today (2.5 weeks since we last saw each other) telling me that I never updated him. I told him that I got my period and I thought he forgot about the whole thing. He replied saying that he was just giving me my space. 

I know I need to move on from this chapter of my life. I guess I’m just curious if he messaged me because he missed me or did he message me to get a peace of mind? I’m not sure because he said he was giving me my space...

TLDR; does my ex-fwb miss me/want to strike up a conversation or did he just want to know that he’s not stuck with a kid?",relationships
"TL;DR I tried to help a friend who was active in addiction, then we became romantic with each other. He got sober, started talking to his ex again, and now I don't even know if we're friends anymore.

So, this is a long one so you will have to prepare yourself. 

I have a friend who I love dearly. He has been having lots of issues with addiction in his life, and there came a point where he turned to me for help. Beforehand, he lived far away and was dating a girl who was abusive to him in a lot of ways, and they were also using together. He finally came home and got better for a little while, but then he relapsed when the girlfriend he had broke up with him. It was at this point that my involvement in trying to help him got maybe a little bit out of hand. 

He didn't have a place to stay anymore, so I opened my home to him and at least tried to keep him safe while he was going through whatever he was trying to get through. We started being romantic with each other a few weeks in, and it started to feel like we were kind of together, even though we had decided it wasn't for the best for us to actually date. That conversation came up a few times though, with him asking me if I ever wanted to be more than friends, telling me he loved me, telling me how beautiful or sexy I was. Stuff like that. We talked often about stuff we wanted to do together in the future, like going camping or on road trips and stuff. I would wake up in the middle of the night to him grabbing my hand just to hold it, or him playing with my hair. He would come up behind me sometimes and hug me, and we would walk down the street holding hands or with our arms around each other. Sometimes he would just kiss me to kiss me. It felt nice, and he was getting better. He was still on and off using, but I tried to stay supportive and also understand that some of this was probably him connecting with the drug and not completely me. It was like we had a companionship and it felt nice to have him around. This went on for months, and from the very start he initiated everything, every time except for one. I tried to respect his space and not overstep or make him uncomfortable because the circumstances were so weird, so I didn't try to push him. I treated every time that something happened like it was the last in my head. 

Things started to get difficult once his ex started talking to him again. I had some hard stuff happen with my family and lost a family member. He helped me through that, but I distinctly remember one time when he was rubbing my back while I was upset, but with the other hand he was texting her. Things never stayed between the two of us, we would watch a movie or listen to a song and he immediately would text her about it. It was like every conversation we had, he was concurrently having the same conversation with her. He lied to her about everything always, including that he was even talking to me, let alone living with me. I will admit I started to get jealous, and it hurt to think that I was just a placeholder or a rebound until she reappeared in his life. I was just a body and a warm bed, it didn't matter that it was me, nor did it matter how much I had done for him. When she came back I went to the wayside and he didn't care whether I was around or not.

Then, he moved out. At this point, I was exhausted physically and emotionally by everything that had happened and the things I had gone through with him. The times that he would use were rough. Sometimes he was really nice, sometimes he was pretty mean, and by the time he left I had been manipulated and played with so much that I didn't have the capacity to really deal with anything anymore, especially him leaving. So I got a little bit clingy, and he told me I was crazy and was driving him crazy. After everything I tried to do for him, he told me to fuck off. It became clear that I didn't mean as much as I thought I did to him, and he was happy to leave me in the dust. It was like I was there to provide to him what he needed until he had bled me dry, and when he was done he was done.

I realized that I don't know him anymore. He got to just up and leave and I am still here in this apartment that we lived in together, by myself during a quarantine. He still talks to her every day I'm pretty sure, but he often ignores my texts or calls. He lost almost everyone else in his life to his addiction and his attitude, besides me and her basically. He hasn't addressed anything with us hooking up or anything since he left. He has become really distant and cold. 

There are a few things I'm pretty sure of, but I have no real clarity from him because he refuses to talk about anything. 

He used me for everything. Sex, money, shelter, and a whole ton of free emotional labor. I'm pretty sure that he was never really attracted to me and it was most likely just the drugs. I feel in some ways like I've been broken up with or left in the dust by someone I did everything for. I feel pretty pathetic and bummed out most of the time. He's on my mind a lot, not just because of whatever feelings I may have developed for him, but also because I'm just generally worried about him relapsing. I also have a weird amount of fear that he and her will end up back together again, or she will move to our town and I will see them walking down the street together or something. 

What I also know is that the feelings I had for him were genuine. The love I had for him, at any point whether it was platonic or romantic, was very real and still is. I know that I got to feel what it was like to be loved by him, and it felt really nice. We've known each other for many years, and to be with him in any capacity felt comfortable and safe. But sometimes I do hate him, and then other times I love and miss him. I wish that we could just go back to being friends and I wish his ex hadn't come back into the picture. 

I don't really even know if I'm looking for advice as much as I'm just trying to get this all out. I don't really talk to anyone about it because it doesn't seem like the people in my life really understands all the circumstances of everything that happened. The only one who really would is him, but he doesn't really want to talk about any of it. I know I shouldn't care because I don't have any control over him or what he does in his life. I know I should stop trying to talk to him and that I should stick to whatever boundaries I have been trying to set. It's just really hard to let go. I sort of wish I could just erase him from my memory sometimes.",relationships
"Hi so I'm in highschool and I've had a few boyfriends which I have said I love you to. But I think I only said it because I felt like I had to, like I really felt like I loved them when I didnt even know how that felt. I used to hate myself in middle school but during sophomore year I started loving myself, which I thought would help me love others but it doesnt change anything.

My first boyfriend was a nerdy guy and not exactly attractive to me but it was middle school at the time and I was so desperate for anyone to even be interested in me. At that time I was socially distant from others, cut and dyed my hair, and tried to act tomboyish. So I had told myself I didnt deserve any love toward me, but he came along and I instantly told myself I liked him because he was interested in me, I didnt even care ab his personality or looks. So after dating for quite a while I broke up with him. I just didnt really love him at all and it felt weird to say I love you. I was bored ig which is pretty messed up cause I didnt really care that I broke up with him. 

Second guy was more recent, we were more serious. Did more things but never all the way. Told each other I love you.  Had inside jokes, went to the pool, haunted houses, sat together in class. But after 6 months of dating he ig lost interest and broke up with me. I cried right after it happened. But after that it was like I wasnt upset at all. I didnt really care and now I'm questioning why I'm so emotionally distant when it comes to actually investing my emotions into a person. 

Now a friend I know told me he has a crush on me but i feel nothing for him, yet i was so excited with the thought. But i really dont like him like that at all. Please someone help.

TL;DR No matter how long I'm with someone it seems by the end of the relationship I dont really care about losing them at all",relationships
"In short growing up my emotions were ignored, I was happy and bright and my parents just watched tv and ignored me. They still to this day watch the same tv show that they would when I was a kid. They payed attention to my older two brothers but never me. Whenever I would be my true self around them they would ridicule my happiness and try to talk me down. If I played guitar or talked to friends online I was being too ""loud"" to my other brothers so I just sat in my room and pretended like I didnt exist for a few years. My childhood was basically trying to spend as much time with my friends as possible so I don't have to go home. When I was with my friends I was happy and had no problems and social but when the moment I walked in home I felt like I had to rip my emotions out and pretend like I didn't exist and became antisocial. I realized because I was so clingy on my friends that I became friends with bad people since they would take me in 24/7, I didnt realize this until I went to threapy. When I turned 18 I told my family I want to do music full time, they talked me down and told me I would never be one. Seeing no financial support I faked college and will graduate next year. The first 2 years of college I commuted, in year 2 I lived in my car because I hated being home so much and worked in a grocery store, I remember lots of nights just crying hoping for connection but I felt so empty and lost. I went for a uni after those two years. I hated college because there was no point in me being there, once I graduate next year I will be a touring musician full time. I am home because of quarantine and Im wondering do I confront them about them ignoring me and talking me down for so long or just slowly cut them out. I have so many mixed emotions when I am here but am totally fine when Im not. I did snap on my dad before I left for uni about how he always bashed everything I stood for and everything that I am, he never made comments like that again, thats the only thing that gives me hope about confronting them, maybe they will realize there mistakes, but he also did not apologize since he seems to""prideful"" for that

"So my bf (37M) and I (31F) were quarantining together, until he decided to have his friend from out of town come and stay with him without asking me. It's his house, but I couldn't help feeling that a little notification on his part would've been nice. I went back to my place because his apartment is kind of small for three people, and I didn't want to get sick since his friend hadn't been isolating. (FYI my dad is going through chemo so if I want to see my parents it's very important for me to isolate.)

Anyway, his friend has been here 12 days and counting. Our anniversary is on Thursday, and bf suggested we could have dinner at home with his friend, which doesn't sound romantic to me at all. (He can't come over to my house because I have a cat and he's allergic.) I feel kind of hurt because I don't understand why he can't have his friend over some other time like when it's not our anniversary? Bf is completely oblivious. Right before his friend came to town my cat became very ill, requiring hospitalization, and he said something about the three of us having drinks together. I know men aren't mind readers, but I told him I'm very upset about my cat and he acted like he didn't care and went to go hang out with his friend. I eventually told him that he wasn't being supportive and he apologized profusely, offering to help me with anything that I need while I'm taking care of my cat. I haven't told him I'm upset about our anniversary being celebrated with his friend yet because I'm not sure if I'm overreacting and I'm curious what other people think.

He's been inconsiderate of me before. When we first started hanging out (just as platonic friends) I remember he said he'd help me with something when we got off work, but then one of his friends came over. She was wanting to get drinks so he blew me off to go have a ""quick"" drink with her. I went with them to the bar and sat there, completely excluded from their conversation, waiting on him to realize I existed again. One of our mutual friends was a bartender at the bar and saw me that night. He said it was painful to watch me being ignored by both of them, even though we weren't dating. I ended up giving him and the girl a ride home while they both continued ignoring me to talk to each other. Once we started dating this girl came to town for his birthday (she's a good platonic friend of his) and the same thing happened again, even though I had mentioned it upsetting me. He acts like he really cares, and I think he does, but then he can be so oblivious at times. 

Tl;dr: I think bf cares about me but is really oblivious and puts friends first even when its our anniversary",relationships
"We were in a relationship for a year, and it was absolutely wonderful in parts, and had its downs. He was very depressed for a lot of the relationship though, due to the extremely toxic work environment we're both a part of. Over time, he said that he'd somehow begun associating me with that environment, even thigh he could see I loved him and cared about him. 

Well, we'll both me moving to different cities in a few months, and he's never believed in long distance. So as the move came closer, he wanted to end things. In this process, he said several different things. Originally, he said he's not completely grieved his previous relationship, which was 3 years long. Then he said he would've wanted to continue the relationship if it wasn't for the distance. Then he said he'd lost feelings for me. Then he said you can't ever completely lose feelings for someone you had strong feelings for. Basically a lot of different things. Then I suggested staying friends, but of course I did not mean immediately. I was completely heartbroken. 

2 weeks in, he starts calling me. I do not answer, as I'm in a horrible place. Again after another week, where we hash out some terrible accusations he'd made, and he says he realizes they were outlandish, and apologizes. Then he begins calling me every 2-3 days, with increasing frequency over time, and we talk for hours on end. He also called me extremely drunk one day, and talked about the most random things. 


The thing is, although the interactions do not discuss our relationship at all, I'm finding it incredibly hard to navigate these 'friendly' conversations. However, I still care about him, and don't want to cut him off completely. Can a person transition from a relationship to a 'friendship' this quickly? Has he really moved on so quickly, that he cab sustain hour long conversations with a very recent ex? How do I navigate this?

I've done some googling and saw you typically find out the gender between 18-20 weeks. This could realistically be mine based on the timeline or she just jumped into bed unprotected with her ex. I don't know how to approach her about this through text or maybe even a phone call.

"I (25/m) love most of my boyfriend's (30/m) friends. They're really nice, funny, fun to be around, and all around very easy to get along with--except one. This guy has done absolutely nothing wrong to me yet I strongly dislike him. Just talking about him bring up feelings of disgust. I can't pinpoint why because he has genuinely been nothing but nice to me, yet I can't help feel disgusted at even the thought of him. I would *never* tell my boyfriend to not be friends with him, but I honestly wish he would drop this friend. He just rubs me the wrong way and I get very bad vibes from him. 

I've definitely tried psychoanalyzing the situation and I've thought, ""maybe I'm jealous of him deep down?"" But they're not super close so it's not like they talk every day. They probably text once every fews days--if that. Then I've questioned whether or not I'm jealous of him in any way, but I personally don't feel like there's anything to be jealous of. I feel like I'm very much above him in many aspects of life. The only thing I can pinpoint is his obsession with talking about sex and guys that he's hooked up with. Which, yes... That can be extremely annoying because it's *constant.* But, I don't think this is a valid reason to be repulsed by someone enough to where you wish your boyfriend would drop them as a friend.

She has a dog, and I've noticed that my allergies have been getting pretty bad (mucus in lungs, coughing, wheezing). She cannot stay at my place because the dog needs to be walked 2x/day and cannot be left alone overnight.

We had talked about moving in together but recently we've decided that with my allergies to her dog as bad as they are, that probably isn't a good idea, at least until I get allergy shots and start showing some immunity to it.

This has been the first time that I've felt concern or uncertainty about our relationship because I would definitely want to live with her if not for my allergies. This seems like it would limit the development of our relationship.

My buddy shown me earlier that she’s In a relationship with him but she posts an “inspirational quote” every few days about how happy she is and how her ex (me) treated her bad and how glad she is to be out of that etc.

"Reposting, added the length of my relationship

In mid February of this year I (27F) started seeing a guy (22) in the army while he was in my hometown for a course (I live in Australia btw). We spent three amazing weeks together, we clicked straight away and spent almost every night together (sneaking onto base and sleeping on two single mattresses on the floor!). He even took me to meet his parents that lived 5 hrs away one weekend. We both fell hard and decided to try long distance and made plans for me to visit him over Easter (he lives 3000 km from me). 
But then covid came along and ruined those plans. It was fine, we knew there wasn’t much we could do about it so we still kept in contact as much as possible. Numerous texts everyday, phone calls at least once a week and numerous memes sent back and forth. He told me he loved me about a month after he flew back home and I was over the moon!

But a couple weeks ago I noticed him becoming more distant. No morning texts and the only time he’d call me was late at night after drinking a lot. I’d try and ask him what was wrong and he’d tell me he was just busy and didn’t always want to be on his phone talking to me non stop. But he’s always active on all his social media so I called him out on it. 

About a week ago we had a huge fight and he told me he didn’t want a relationship anymore. His reasoning was because when he got back home he’d got back into his routine and just wanted to do his own thing without having to worry about being on his phone texting me all the time, and that he was constantly upset. But then straight after saying that he said he did want to be with me but that he was confused, and that he did still love me. I was heartbroken. I still am. But I can kinda see where he’s coming from, I was getting a little bit clingy but only because I could sense him pulling away. 

I was getting frustrated with the whole situation of not being able to see him so I was definitely highly strung when talking to him so maybe that’s why he started backing off.

Since our fight last week it’s been really different. We hardly text anymore, and when we do it’s really short and of not much substance. He hasn’t said he loves me since. And when I try and bring up anything to do with us he completely ignores it and acts like everything is okay. I asked him if he still loved me and his answer was “I dunno, it feels weird writing it” - what does that even mean??!! 

I don’t know what to do anymore to make it better. I’m giving him as much space as possible, I don’t text him until he does and I try not to ask him too many questions but I really just need the reassurance that we’re okay- and if we aren’t I need to know that too so I can stop wasting my time.

"Using a throwaway because my main is connected to my work. This one isn’t upsetting and it’s really not the biggest deal in my life, I’m just looking for advice if you can offer it. I (19f) been friends with a boy (20m) i met at my uni for almost a year now, and at first our relationship was a little awkward but then we quickly realized that we are EXTREMELY similar in terms of interests and opinions; and we very quickly became best friends. For a while I thought he was into me because we were constantly jokingly flirting and teasing with each other (i didn’t just imagine this either, my friends believed the same thing), but then he went on a couple dates with this girl back in january so I assumed he was never interested and we were just joking as friends. 
He stopped talking to the girl a while back, (note: this entire time we have remained best friends, i would tell him anything and vice versa) and we still jokingly flirt but i’m not even sure if he realizes he’s doing it, or if he does but he thinks it’s strictly platonic. He’s one of the nicest people i’ve ever met and i am so glad to have him in my life, his friendship to me comes FIRST no matter what, which is why i’m asking for advice, i’m scared to mess anything up. I’m just wondering if it’s worth trying to chase my feelings for him. truthfully i can handle rejection, but I can’t handle him not being in my life as much as he is now, I talk to him more than anyone and I don’t want that to change. 
If you have any advice on what to do that would be great :)

"So my (M25) ex-girlfriend (F24) has me messed up.  She broke up with me (6 month relationship) saying that I ate too much.  However, I already realized I was big and was already losing weight.  When I was with her I lost about 30lbs, and before we even started dating I already lost approximately 70lbs. I am angry because I feel like she took all of my hardwork and just spat on it and said it was nothing. Now I've lost about another 20lbs so I have lost about 120lbs so far.  So now I feel like i am just a blob and gave me a ""complex"" if you will. All of my results feel like nothing, and I have to get skinny/jacked as possible. 

I feel what she said was dirty and a low blow to do that, with her knowing I was working on this already.  I just feel like it's my fault and I can't get that feeling out of me and its frustrating.   

However the thing is I don't know why I still have strong feelings for her.  I've been quite a few dates since then but I keep comparing and I don't know why and I know it isn't fair to those other women.  How do I get her and what she said out of my head? 

thanks in advance

"I have been with my boyfriend for a few months now and have addressed the fact that I feel uncomfortable with him bantering with other women. He's telling me that I'm reading into things and he's just a friendly person, but I still feel insecure about where he stands in the relationship. I wanted some opinions from others to see if he is acting interested in other women.

He has many female friends and always teases them when they talk. He'll be saying things like, ""go away Katherine, no one wants to talk to you"" in a joking way or saying things like, ""ew shut up, I hate you."" or saying things like, ""hey Ashley, where's my hi?"" or ""wow you clearly want me, too bad I'm too good for you hahaha."" 

He sends other girls hearts and wink emojis as well as smirk emojis. He goes around saying things like, ""you're such a nerd"" or ""oh hey little shorty."" He also compliments other girls' selfies on Instagram. 

I've confronted him about this, but he said he's always been like this therefore he isn't flirting with other women. He said he's just a very friendly person who enjoys talking to everyone. 

TLDR: Boyfriend teases and engages in banter with other women calling them things like loser, nerd, shorty etc for fun or telling them to go away or asking where his greeting from them is etc above. He uses smirk emojis and hearts, and compliments girls' selfies but says he's always been this way because he's friendly. Is he being unloyal or is this how a guy should act?",relationships
"Suspicious girlfriend

So this girl I've been dating for a couple months is acting quite suspicious. We were fwb for about 5-6 months and then decided to date. Everything was ok until recently, caught her in a couple lies (which weren't necessarily huge deals but still) and now I'm suspicious.

Because of her lies she said she'd do anything to help regain my trust, we've been working through it but it came to the point where I felt it was necessary to ask to see her best friend list on Snapchat. We were on FaceTime when I asked and it took her way too long to do what I asked, she then sent me a list of her chats but I told her that's not what I asked for and got a lil upset and hung up. I texted her and told her to send me her best friends list and she kept saying I was being too rude, and she constantly kept denying my calls.

Finally picked up and told me that she hid something, finally sent her best friend list and her only best friends were me and dudes and her mom. Some of them she was doing a project with which she proved, but the two she deleted had no excuse. She told me she deleted them because she knew I would overthink it. 

The next day after pestering her to figure out who they were, she finally came clean and told me that one was an old friend from high school who is suicidal or something? Idrk, but the other one was an old fwb and she said she only sent a pic of her forehead (he was not on the best friends list tho, she just hid him). She then went and cleared her entire Snapchat of guys.

Not sure what to do here, any advice?

EDIT: She lied to me multiple times about where she was and who she was with and she ended up being with other guys.

I DID NOT WANT TO SEE HER SNAPCHAT BUT IT WAS MY LAST RESORT!!!!!

TL;DR - Caught her in lies, sent me her snap and deleted dudes, one was an old fwb and said she only responded w a pic of her forehead.",relationships
"I am a full time engineer in a very traditional, older office. About a year ago, my mom was told that her scleroderma had spread to her lungs, heart, and digestive track, and she needed to undergo a stem cell transplant with a 30% risk of mortality. She started her treatment in September, and the next four months were incredibly taxing on me, as she nearly died during the procedure. I'm also in grad school at night, which made things very difficult. 

The day she was told that her procedure was a success was the day I found out that my best friend of the last decade died horrifically (falling 1000 feet to his death). It was traumatic as he was my first real boyfriend, and became my closest friend post-breaking up. Losing him felt like I lost my arm. 

In the middle of grieving, I started developing a lot of pain, eventually going to the ER. I learned I was having kidney issues. I had been receiving tests for an array of symptoms for the last five years, but something clicked for my doctor and she realized that I have Sjogren's Disease. I was put on meds and SSRIs which have their own difficulties. Though the initial diagnoses was a relief, I've become very depressed recently, now that I have realized that the diagnoses /= easy treatment and relief from symptoms. 

Shortly after that, the pandemic happened, and my entire family is high risk. Very stressful. My aunt got coronavirus and she died on a ventilator as we said goodbye on Facetime. This was a month ago.

I then found out that my current boyfriend has been combing through his instagram and flirting with old crushes, so we're going through a break up.

My productivity has come to a complete halt. I can't focus on anything. I'm missing all my deadlines. Doing any bit of activity exhausts me and I want naps all day, but can't sleep at night. I got really sick, and had a fever for four days, so I took last Thursday and Friday off. I meant to catch up on projects over the weekend, but I was so tired and just slept. 

I don't want to go on short term disability, because there are strong ableism vibes at work, and I don't know when I will be able to find work again, because my state is heavily effected by the pandemic.

I haven't logged onto Skype all day. I don't know what is wrong with me. I want to ask for a week off because I think I need to process some grief, but I am worried I look like a slacker full of excuses. How can I ask for this time off without looking whiney or sounding lazy? I'm just so overwhelmed and tired all the time. Will it impact how I look to the office if I ask for this time off. I don't have any friends at work, as it is mostly older, married men, or people with children. People at my office just power through everything. A woman I know lost her mother, and only took a week off. I feel so weak and pathetic.

TL;DR: I am struggling with my mental health due to my mother's stem cell transplant, my best friend and Aunt dying, my autoimmune diagnoses, and working full-time while in grad school. I want to ask for a week off, but I already took two days off for a fever. I don't want to come off as lazy or whiney, but I am worried that I will be seen as such because I work in a very traditional engineering office. I really feel like I am barely hanging on, but don't know what to do. How can I ask for this time off without risking my career? Is this a bad idea?",relationships
"I’m seeing a man twice my age, me (f21), him being 45

So i started seeing this man who is double my age. we met on tinder. and i don’t feel like he’s a sugar daddy type. i wasn’t talking to him to be my sugar daddy. i was genuinely interested in him. he is very attractive to me and once we started talking i felt like there was just an instant attraction from both of us. i’ve only seen him in person once. we hung out at his apartment and we had a couple of drinks. he talked to me about his marriage, his kids, how he lived in latin america for a while and how he easy it was to date nowadays. i really liked the chemistry that was there. i wasn’t sure if he felt the same but then the sexual tension rose. lol this is where it gets explicit. we were having sex, we did two rounds and he kept saying how he liked me and how pretty i was. we laughed the whole night and then i left. he works a lot so we don’t text much. but we do text the right amount to keep both of us still interested in each other. 
now the problem for me is that i don’t want to waste my time in something that isn’t going to last. i really do like him, he is so interesting and we just vibe off of each other. he said that our chemistry is unbelievable. i don’t know what he wants out of this. i don’t know if he just wants me to be around because he likes the idea of me? me being a latina (his ex wife is colombian), being 5 ft and being 21. while he is white dominant male, 6’3 and 45. 
i also don’t know if it’s too early to ask him what he wants? i feel like i’m going to scare him away, but honestly i don’t want to waste my time if it’s meaningless. i know i’m young, but i’ve been through tooo much to waste my time like this. i know we’re at different stages of life but i still don’t know what he wants out of this? i just want to know what his intentions are. but i don’t know if it’s too soon to ask, i don’t want to scare him away. i’m seeing him tomorrow and i’m spending the night. should i ask tomorrow?

"I need some help. I (18 Female) have this ex (18 Male) we just split, I’m the one who broke it off. we were together for a year. I want to explain my reasons for ending it and get an opinion on him and one certain thing.

• I told him I felt like I looked crazy and I sent him a picture of me. He said, “I’ve seen uglier.”

•He had a group chat with his friends were they talked about all the hot girl that wanted their numbers.

•When I didn’t text back when he wanted he call over and over until I did.

•we were cuddling and I said I needed to movie because I was uncomfortable. He squeezed me and refused to let me move. I kept asking him to let me up and he said no. He kept trying to kiss me. He’d say, “ my sister knows we’ve kissed before what’s the issue?” (This was in a public place) He told me later that I needed to stop getting so flustered

•He liked to bring up all of the girls that liked him and wanted

•I take an anti depressant and I’m not very open about it. He said once in a public place, “I have this friend that’s like you on your meds but more hyper.” He never fully understood why I was upset by it.

•he liked to make me feel guilty if I didn’t say happy anniversary exactly when he wanted but he didn’t know my birthday.

•I told him I was busy during the day but I would see him later and he said, “if you’re going to do that then you can kiss me later or send me a picture of you now.” (I hadn’t kissed him yet. This was very early on)

•for ages he’s said that he likes when I’m hyper. A bit ago he said, “you should stop being hyper as often it gets annoying.”

•Finally. I went to a fair with him. I am absolutely terrified of heights and we were at the top of the Ferris wheel. I was holding his hand because I was scared. Want to know what he did? He kept turning my head so I’d kiss him and I’d turn back and he’d do it again and again. Then he moved the hand he was holding between his legs. I was so scared of the heights I didn’t even notice until he turned my head and I saw my hand. I kissed him so he’d stop and I moved my hand. I ended up looping my arm around his so he couldn’t do it again. He instead put his hand very far up my leg.

•bonus. We were in a photo booth. He refused to take a photo with until I kissed him. And you know that cute couple thing we’re one stands behind the other and holds behind them? Everything we did that he’d try to grind into me. Public space or not. Once I walked away to talk to his sibling and he followed me and did it again. It made me feel gross.

TL:DR My ex is an absolute asshole and I’m worried that some of this is sexual harassment.

That’s all I’ve got. I appreciate any advice y’all can spare. I just want an outside opinion. And I’m concerned that this is considered sexual harassment or is that an overreaction? 💜",relationships
"Well, here I go. Unfortunately, this intro may be a cliche. 

My fiancé and I have been together for 5 years and are, for the most part, pretty happy together. 

We get along wonderfully, have really grown together over our relationship, and I truly do love everything we’ve built together. The start of our relationship was a bit unusual as we were pretty much strictly platonic friends until the night we hooked up and ever since then have been together. Because of this, we never really had dates or anything. Just friends who hung out exclusively to suddenly romantic partners. 

Of course, in the beginning, we had sex pretty often. I never expected that to be sustainable and figured that as we got older, we’d find a more sustainable routine. But instead, I just feel like it’s been slowly fizzling out.

Several times, I’ve tried to talk to him about what I’m feeling. Just the general lack of romance, him initiating sex, or just making me feel desired. Those conversations are never bad, but they do almost always end in him saying he doesn’t know why we’re not having as much sex and that he’s sorry. Back in December, I actually wrote out a note for him in the hopes that it would give him a better opportunity to think of that “why”. He read it, said he would gather his thoughts, and then never brought it up again. 

Before getting together, we spoke extensively about sex and our hopes in a relationship. They ideal being once or twice a day, but really, even just a few times and week and some masturbation would be plenty. But now it’s more like sex once a week where I don’t cum. If that. 

He has been stressed at work lately and when I asked him if everything was okay yesterday, he again just said he didn’t know why we weren’t having sex and was sorry. The closest thing to an answer that I got was that he just felt bad about always having lazy sex and other sex (meaning sex where I cum during intercourse and not just masturbating after) was too much work.

I just feel completely undesirable and unattractive. Before we got together, he mentioned he was attracted to pink nipples and pale girls. I’m a black woman and just feel like... I don’t know, everything else is going so well with us that he just won’t admit it he’s not attracted to me. I mean, sex may be work sometimes, but isn’t that supposed to be fun sometimes? I’m not saying I want it like that every day, just every now and then. 

What do you think?

TL;DR: Fiancé of 5 years can’t explain why we keep having less and less sex. The closest answer was that sex where I cum is too much work. It genuinely feels like everything else in the relationship works, but I’m worried he’s just not attracted to me and too afraid to admit it. What should I do?",relationships
"While quarantine's been going on, I've taken up to bumble and been swiping through talking with ladies. 

I've matched with somebody. immediately thought they were great. We get to talking and things are going pretty well. We've gone through the phone call, random question phases, video chats, etc. Texting a lot. I mean this thing is churning. Definitely heading somewhere. 

As this pandemics been going on, because of the severity of the situation, We very quickly gotten to talking about values and what we find important especially later on in a relationship. 

** I recently gotten out of a 4-year-old relationship and during this time I've definitely started looking to move on and find somebody else. I'm past the rebound phase and looking to meet somebody else. I'm being of course very cautious and that's why I'm writing in this subreddit. There's a lot of things that I think I'd be willing to miss and forgo because of where I was in my previous relationship. **

I'm definitely looking for something more serious. more long-term. She is as well. We are both cafeteria Catholics to an extent a lot of things. Especially when it comes to premarital sex (balla shot colla 20-in rims on my Impala). 

Where she's definitely on the far end of the luby's when it comes to Catholicism is she only wants to have one kid. 

This is because she grew up as an only child It's very comfortable for her. She has a problem with favorites and she feels that she would definitely have favorites when it came to more than two kids. She had all the attention from her parents growing up. There's some family history around the second born cousin of hers that became very ill and wasn't able to be attended to because the parents had the child to save the marriage.
It's been a very clear line in the sand from her. She's not going to entertain anything other than one child because of a variety of different situations.

I grew up one of three brothers. Middle child to be exact. I still talk with both of my brothers everyday. we're very close. I can't imagine life without them and us being so close and age (18 months apart), made going to college and joining the workforce so much easier. We were all in it together. 

She really hasn't heard my side of the story and I plan on unveiling this to her slowly.  As much as I detested being the middle child and there were times where I had a lot of hardships of having a sibling you can't get rid of them and they're actually wonderful. They're your blood. your kin. They have your back no matter what. 

Another important point is having siblings creates a level of diplomacy. There's a tact for negotiation it comes with having a sibling. This is something I think that she's missed. I feel like if I had a child I'd be putting them at a disadvantage by locking them up in the room by themselves and forcing them to just hang out with the neighbor kids. I think I have a much better understanding of dynamics how people operate because of my brothers. 

Now to be fair, this doesn't mean that I want to just pump out as many kids as possible. It's all about setting the children up for success I'm not saying five is what I'm gunning for here. I'm willing to at least meet her in the middle with two. 

Besides her line of the sand mentality when it comes to the number of children, She really is quite wonderful to talk to. Very smart, financially driven, wonderful smile, etcetera etcetera the list goes on and on. 

Here is where I need help

Is this an actual deal breaker for her? Or is this just her attempt to continue to be in a comfort zone?

Should I be concerned that she's not even willing to entertain my thoughts on this? Where I come from my perspective of things? 

Do you think this is going to be her way or the highway throughout the relationship and I'm just going to get tossed around like a rag doll until I get fed up with it and break up with her? Then once I break up with her is it going to be a non-stop whirlwind of crazy Town? 

* Important to consider. I understand that this is a way down the line topic and we really even haven't had nearly enough physical communication with one another. *

"EDIT: I guess it’s more like unintentional gaslighting, if that can be a thing.

There is a lot about our friendship that's incredibly blurry; I'm not sure if I've tried to suppress what has happened or I if I have simply forgotten. What I'll write is my best recollection of what has happened, but I'm undoubtedly leaving stuff out. I can say, however, that I've messed up, as she has.

It's worth noting that I'm graduating from HS and she is a rising HS senior. I think she is an AWESOME person (she has a really pure heart and is intelligent), but she is not right for me; we don't have the right chemistry to be friends. I also really don't want to hurt her feelings and I'm not sure I can just block her because of professional needs.

**Some necessary background:** We started becoming friends sometime in September, I believe -- though we knew each other slightly from a semester ago. It was at a time that was bad for me. I was lonely and depressed (I think I have seasonal depression), and she was new in school. We started talking from time to time. Around then, I was directing a really big event, for about 500 people and she volunteered as a staff member for it. At one point, under all the stress I yelled at her for asking a question or doing something wrong. After the event, she expressed how bad she felt about me going off, and I apologized, for I realize it was a shitty thing to do. Doing that, I think I didn't want to lose one of the only people I had -- even if we weren't really that close -- so I told her about my depression and how I thought that might have ignited me acting that way. Perhaps it was manipulative, and I'm not sure if I did it on purpose, though I believe much of my mood swings were due to depression and the insane amount of stress I was in. We kept talking then.

Now, since about December/January, I have realized how different we are. Our personalities are nothing alike and I truly don't feel comfortable around her. I truly feel like she polices everything I do; at that time, she started pointing out little, truly absurd things (like helping someone more than her in one of the clubs I run) and saying I did those to hurt her. I honestly believe I didn't do anything, especially nothing on purpose. But fights started flaming up all the time due to that ""policing."" Since then I never felt comfortable around her, for I felt everything I texted, said, or did was being examined and judged. She also has a very different perspective on things, which worsens it. At that time, I tried keeping conversations going with her. She doesn't have many friends, so I felt shitty about just cutting contact with her. But she was very intense and she definitely thought (and thinks) we were closer than we are. She says stuff like ""I love you"" and ""you are the big brother I never had,"" which honestly makes me really uncomfortable, for I never know what to answer and we are definitely not nearly that close (she doesn't know very basic stuff about me, like I don't know basic stuff about her). So I started to be dry and text less, but she wouldn't get the hint. I admit that I should have been way more direct then and I regret that. Sometime in between (December), she also confessed that she liked me and I turned her down as nicely as possible, but she used that to victimize herself INTENSELY. She said I was awful for doing that, and for a long time, I suspected many of the problems in our relationship stemmed from her not being able to think of me as a friend, even though she told me she was over it. For like 3 months she went back and forth about how she felt, saying that she lied and never liked me, and then that her lying was a lie and so on... it was wild.

Sometime in February, we had a MUCH bigger fight. Over the same little action policing, she said I made her ""birthday week"" miserable. The day before her birthday she called me out on me ""not doing enough"" (yes, the day before her birthday), and she went off, insulting me like no one ever has. I never insulted her because I don't see the point of lowering someone like that. The wild(er) thing is that after fights she always ends up laughing and telling me how much she loves me. What was/is her closest friend at school told me that night that she was obsessed with me and wouldn't stop talking about me. Like, would not stop talking about me, putting me in a pedestal one second and saying how AWFUL I was the next. That night I realized I was done. So I told her the next day how I felt. I was very direct, but I never insulted her. The following days she texted me paragraphs of I don't remember what, and I felt so shitty that I went back on my word, saying that I needed space but I could give her another try. She doesn't understand the concept of space. Every time I've asked for it, she's said: ""We are not dating, what is this space bullshit?"" And even when she has said yes, she just texts me the next day with the exact same intensity and with no less clinginess and closeness.

As of most recent, I just can't do it anymore. Thinking about what I'm going to say to her so that she doesn't get hurt or mad is so fucking hard. Whenever I see a message from her my heart starts palpitating and going at FULL speed (and she sends like 10 in a row). I honestly think it's something like PTSD. I dread answering her. So Friday I told her about these physical responses and she seemed understanding. But, contradicting, her whole thing is that I should leave the past behind and I should concentrate on the present. I told her to give me space and she literally texts me the next day with some stuff like ""you really are like my big bro, even giving me the silent treatment."" It gives me so much anxiety to see that. It physically hurts. I deleted our messaging app because I couldn't stand seeing her messages. Today, I had to redownload it for school.

A few hours ago, she texted me ""are you done mistreating me?"" and that hurts. I don't wanna hurt her feelings, but I know this going back and forth is toxic -- for both of us. I can't cut her out of my life because she has a leadership role in one of the clubs I managed this year.

I literally don't know if I'm toxic or if she is. I admit I haven't been the most supportive (and this is something she always points out to me) -- but how could I when I've never felt comfortable. I have suppressed a lot of what has happened in our friendship because it hurts to think about it, and I'm truly doubting if it's my toxicity or hers. Sometimes when I try to end it, she's like ""but I supported you with your event and your depression and you are just gonna leave me?"" (not verbatim, obviously).

The way I see it: she is a great person, but not the right friend for me. Reddit, what do I do? I would feel really guilty by blocking her.

**TL;DR: My friend and I seem to have a toxic relationship. She is very intense and whenever I try to leave, she won't let me. I feel like dogshit if I hurt her (and I've already made her cry trying to get away), but it physically pains me to interact with her. I'm creeped out by how close she thinks we are and I think it's unfair for her that she puts so much more effort than I do into our friendship. I'm confused about whether I'm an asshole, she is toxic, or if we are both toxic.**",relationships
"All right, so y'all probably need to know how it got to this. When I was 14 months old, I was diagnosed with type one diabetes, and my parents were dirt poor AND our city had terrible doctors for juvenile diabetes. So as a toddler and up until now, my mother slept in the same bed as me because she was scared I was going to bottom out and would be unable to get to them OR I would hurt myself trying to treat it(I have woken up in a low daze and smacked my head really hard and have fainted from being low, so it's not an unfounded fear).

Problem is, it never stopped. She still sleeps in the same bed as me. Up until middle school, I thought that it was completely normal, but when I let it slip, I learned it really wasn't. But hey, it's my mom, right? She just loves me and things will are fine, this is our normal. PLUS, I was only a kid, so who was I to question what was going on?

Well, I'm 21 now, and it still hasn't stopped. When I asked her to start sleeping with my Dad about six years ago, she said her mattress was just so uncomfortable and blew up and threw a tantrum about how I don't care if she has a sore back, shoulders, knees, ect. All right, fine. Well, my grandparents caught wind of her still sleeping in the same room as me when I was 16, and they bought her and my Dad a new mattress. She still refuses to move because my Dad hogs the bed and is snores loudly, so she can't sleep. When she got the new mattress, she would try to sleep there, then come into my room, kick my mattress until I woke up, and forced me to move over. Due to unrelated issues, I do not sleep well. If I'm woken up suddenly, I wake up in a panic, and then I'm so nervous I stay awake until morning. My mom knew this, and when I begged her to NOT to kick my mattress to wake me up, but she just said it ""wouldn't be a problem"" if I would stop being ""childish"".

Well, I really want to sleep in my bed, on my own. But now every time I bring it up, the rest of the family(twin sisters, 19F and my Dad, 45M) starts telling me how much of an ungrateful brat I am and how I don't love my mother. You know, ""my house, my rules, and if your mom wants to sleep in your bed and your room, then she can because she bought this house and bought this mattress"". I've stopped bringing it up because my family basically accuses me of accusing my mother of doing ""weird things"" to me when we all know nothing like that is happening.

How the hell do I get my mom to sleep in her room, and not mine?

TLDR; I was diagnosed with diabetes as a baby, my mom started sleeping my room to make sure i was okay, and she still does that when I'm 21 years old. The rest of my family tells me I'm an asshole for trying to change this dynamic. No clue what to do.",relationships
"
My(25f) boyfriend (28m) and I have been together for a year but have a long history before that. He drinks pretty much constantly except when he goes to work. He has a dangerous job and realizes he can’t drink before, which is good at least. He drinks every day after work and pretty much  all weekend starting when he wakes up if there’s any alcohol in the house. I feel like everyone he knows constantly enables him. He drinks with his coworkers every day after work, his friends always drink when they get together, our neighbor owns a rum distillery and gives him free bottles, his parents offer him alcohol any time we go over there, if I have a beer or two it definitely encourages him although I’ve stopped bringing alcohol home or going to get beer if he asks me to and often say “no thank you, I don’t need to drink everyday” if he offers me beer. Kind of sassy, I know. I’ve seen him quit drinking for about a month before and for a couple days here and there. He’s still super friendly when he drinks but he often just passes out and can’t follow through with plans, which is frustrating as hell. Long term, I’m worried if I stay with him, he’s going to have health problems or die young and I’ll be left to pick up the pieces. 

On the other hand, I love him dearly. He’s sweet and thoughtful, we have a good time together and he always makes me feel safe and loved. He’s never controlling and he’s always supportive. We’ve talked a lot about spending our lives together but I’m worried because of the drinking. I know he drinks to deal with depression. I’ve tried talking with him before and it initially didn’t go well but he tried to cut back afterwards for a week or so, then it escalated again. I don’t think I said it as well as I could have which is probably why it didn’t go well initially. I don’t want to be that controlling girlfriend who tells him what to do and also realize I can’t make an alcoholic stop drinking, but I’m also pretty concerned about it. Any thoughts on what I could say to him or what to do?

Tl;dr my boyfriend drinks way too much but I also love him dearly and we talk about spending our lives together. I’m worried if I commit to being with him, He’ll eventually have health problems or die young and ill just end up heartbroken and picking up the pieces. What should I do? I want to try talking to him about the drinking again.",relationships
"I live with my mom and her husband in a pretty small town. Sometime last year, my mom told her neighbors about her financial difficulties and since then they stop by with a box of food from the food bank about every other week. Despite my mom’s financial problems, she’s never struggled to put food on the table and she’s never asked for them to bring food but she has asked them to stop. 

When I moved in, the food drop offs continued and I could tell it was really bothering my mom and making her very embarrassed. She always brings the food back to the food bank because we don’t need it and there are a lot more people out there who do. When they tried to drop the box of food off with me, I told them as politely as I could that we don’t want or need the food and for them to please stop giving it to us and they said they would be she was visibly angry that  I had asked. 

They just dropped some more off, just leaving it on our front porch. It’s driving me a little crazy, I feel like they’re intentionally and passive aggressively trying to embarrass us. I don’t know what else to do to get them to stop without causing more tension. 

TLDR: neighbors keep giving us boxes of donated food that we don’t want or need.",relationships
"My sister has been acting very hostile the past couple of years or so and I don't know what to do with it anymore. My main issue is that she doesn't communicate when she's upset and we just find ourselves cut off for no reason despite attempts to talk to her. There has been multiple incidents already but I'll put down the ones that have stood out the most. Important to note that she is currently living in a different country.

* During the funeral of our sister, she volunteered to chip in to help shoulder the funeral costs. She also rented a car to help shuttle everyone around. I was making what amounts to $500/month (I live in Asia) and I even needed to borrow money just to fly back home and be there for the funeral.Later my grandmother called me saying my sister was furious with me for not volunteering to help pay for the car. I was very transparent with my financial situation when we started talking about the funeral. I even volunteered to no longer fly home and just give that money I borrowed to help pay. She said no, I had to be there. She never told me she was upset about this and I just learned that she was mad through my grandmother. I reached out to her and apologized for not having enough to help and shouldered costs of food, whatever I can with the last few $40 I had. No reply. Later I sent her pictures of the family from the funeral, etc. because she asked for them in the family group chat. She posted the pictures I took, tagged all our siblings, and didn't tag me. I was hurt but I brushed this off and moved on.
* Last year my grandmother and dad got into an argument (they made up eventually). My sister started messaging everyone in our family bad-mouthing my father. She lashed out at my dad's sister and girlfriend for not taking my grandmother's side. They both reminded her gently (I saw the messages) that she should be transparent with our dad about what she feels about this fight. Her feelings were valid but that she should communicate this to the person involved instead of lashing out at everyone else. To this day, I'm fairly certain she hasn't talked to my dad about this. She also lashed out at me and my brother and I tried to reassure her I know where her feelings come from but that she should also communicate with our dad. She just retorted back ""So you think I'm wrong?"" and left it at that, despite attempts to assure her, reach out to her.
* I got a phone call from my grandmother saying my sister wanted to buy her a brand new car but since she's far away, my sister wants to take a car loan under my name but she'll be making the payments. I said that I need to learn more about the loan, asked questions about possibly buying second-hand (they didn't want to, said second-hand will cause more problems). I said that I need time to think about it since a car loan is a huge financial commitment. I also asked to talk to my sister about this so I can figure out what she wants to do and we go about it. After this conversation I got repeated texts from my grandmother like ""I wish you would just help your sister."" or ""She won't leave you hanging, you're family."" And my response has always been ""Please ask her to call me about this."" Apparently my sister just went ""never mind"" and shut me out.
* During Christmas, she posted a greeting like ""Merry Christmas to MY FAMILY(name of brother), (name of grandmother)."" I felt it a bit odd but sent her and her husband a nice greeting anyway. She said ""Merry Christmas"" back.
* Recently she has made public posts on Facebook about wanting some government officials and their family to die —it was pretty violent. I reached out to her saying that while I support her calling out government incompetence, violent/death threats might not look good on a social media post. She apologized and then closed off with ""Bye."" I tried to have a conversation about the pandemic, etc. and she never replied again.

I don't know what to do anymore at this point. Throughout the whole time with my sister I've tried to reassure her that I love her and I want/am always available to talk especially if/when she has problems but she has repeatedly opted to shut me out. I find out she's upset through other people and when I ask her if anything is wrong, she doesn't respond. She's hot and cold. Sometimes I think we're on good terms and sometimes, I find myself blocked on Facebook. Then added back again. It has been heart-breaking that she refuses to communicate and I have been extremely anxious about making her upset again. Whenever we talk I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. I dread calls from my grandmother sometimes because I worry it'll be another thing my sister is (surprise!) upset about again. Should I just stop trying to have at the very least, a civil relationship?

TL;DR: My sister gets upset but never speaks to me about it. I try to have a conversation and open up to her but she shuts me out. Should I just stop trying?",relationships
"I'm sorry if this comes off as a rant. I'm trying to format this so it makes sense, but I'm looking for advice because I don't know what to do or say.

So months ago, my boyfriend and I we're talking about how much he and I had baby fever( I have a 2 year old from a different relationship). I brought up that I would want to be married first. We had been trying for months before that and no luck, and I was beginning to get stressed out. But I guess it gave me more time to think about it because I didn't realize I didn't feel completely secure in our relationship yet. He got really defensive and at first brought up that it would just be bringing religion into our relationship(he's atheist). I said I wouldn't want a church wedding anyways. Then he said he didn't want to because he wanted kids first. I repeated I wasnt comfortable with that, and that I didnt want to be married right away anyways, I wanted to work on our relationship first and become more stable. He then said it's just a way for me to take half of his things because I'm the woman. I said we could get a prenup. I want to go back to school for my career anyways. We stopped talking about it because he kept saying how much he wanted kids rights away first, and it felt like he was completely ignoring that I wasn't comfortable with that.
After about a week he said he changed his mind and that he agreed with me.
Some backstory, in the beginning of our relationship, I had caught my boyfriend lying about his ""just friends."" He told me that he wasnt speaking to his ex(which he was and he had bought coke off her, which he knew I was against and lied about that as well.) And an old fuckbuddy who was also a cokeheadand had been reaching out to him alot for a hookup but his motorcycle was broken and she lived a few hours away. He said he shot her down but he deleted the messages(and she was in a relationship with her baby daddy, the times he had been with her, she wasn't single.) There were other things he did that he lied about but those hurt the most. When I found out he seemed to be genuinely remorseful at first. He blocked them and his other fuckbuddies he's had, and hasn't done any drugs other than smoking a bit of weed, but not alot and not when my daughter was home. After a few months I found out that he had cheated on two of his past girlfriends - only online- (out of three) and he blamed not being able to get attached to friends and partners on his first GF that broke his heart in highschool. Both him and his family said hes been a happier and open person since we had started dating, so I feel like he's actually becoming more emotionally mature then what he was like before.
However I told him I needed to talk through how I felt after I found out everything. For first year it was me trying to tell I felt and he'd get defensive and tell me to get over it, which made it worse.
I broke down to him when a close family member died and I begged him to help me because of the quarantine, I couldn't see any of my family. I told him how lonely he had made me feel, and that I felt overwhelmed. So he started letting me open up to him gradually.
I found out I was pregnant and he was happy about it. He told me we'll still get married, just after the baby is born.
Now I'm 9 weeks and a few days ago my mom asked if we plan on getting married and I said one day and he said so aswell, she had a few glasses of wine and started over stepping, saying that we could just get it done at a courthouse and have a gathering for close relatives after, going on about what it would be like. I guess that made my boyfriend uncomfortable, but he didn't speak up and he didnt mention it to me until today.
He said he doesn't believe in marriage and that it's just a way for the government to be apart of our relationship( even though he knows we'll be commonlaw  as soon as the baby is born). And that, "" if you think I do anything wrong, you'll just take half of what I have anyways."" And I told him we can get a prenup but he doesn't seem to be listening.

TMI but I'm scared he just told me he'd want to be married one day so I'd be comfortable with unprotected sex with him. He treats condoms like they're the plague, and I can't do hormonal birth control and I had a horrific time incident with using an IUD.
I don't know what to do and I'm feeling lost.

TL;DR! - months ago my boyfriend and I discussed marriage and he said he'd want to eventually. Now that I'm pregnant he says he doesnt want to. ***",relationships
"So I recently formed a band with these two other guys from my area, it was right before the quarantine so I have nothing to show for it yet. I'm hoping, however, that we will get together soon. My mom doesn't feel the same way now that she knows about the drummer's relationship.

See, the drummer is gay, and is dating an autistic boy 3 months older than him, and my mom is convinced that they are sexual deviants (the drummer is asexual and the boyfriend had sexual boundary issues around 5 years ago) and that the drummer has to be deeply disturbed to date someone like that.

She continually tries to pass it off like its an actual safety concern, but after years of dealing with her shit for being bi I see exactly what's happening: she doesn't like that he's gay and feels the insider information she has vindicates that hatred.

She wanted me to leave the band, but I approached her today with two questions: were the slight boundary and hygiene issues all there was, and how old was he. She didn't know and he was thirteen. So I started picking apart her logic.

For one, I was an autistic thirteen year old. I had the exact same boundary issues he did to begin with: talking about masturbation at inappropriate times and doing it in inappropriate places (never in public, just in like my grandma's bathroom or mine when we had guests over). It took a friend telling me it wasn't normal to finally fix my behavior.

Secondly, she'd constantly fuck up her language. She'd go from ""I don't know if he's mature enough to date someone drummer's age"" to ""he's too low functioning to be in a gay relationship"" and constantly pointing to his ""sexual deviancy"" AKA one time he masturbated in the living room when no one was there and his mom came home early. Five years ago.

I told her I wasn't quitting but I knew that if I didn't play along with her sexual deviancy comments I'd be lit up with screaming. She then tried to convince me that the guitarist and I needed to oust him from the band, and I kind of skirted around it, to which she accused me of betraying my family's trust and decided to end the conversation.

Should I leave the band? I'm moving out as soon as I can find a roommate, and I should have enough for two month's rent by the end of June to help me get on my feet. I'm currently employed by my parents.

TL;DR: my band's drummer has a boyfriend who is also autistic, and my mom thinks he's coercing him into a gay relationship, basically demanding we kick him out or I leave the band. I'm autistic as well, and I am calling complete bullshit.",relationships
"I dated this guy in high school for about a year before we went to college. I broke it off because we were so different (family backgrounds, political beliefs, etc.) and we didn’t go to the same high school. Plus I was immature and had a mentally ill parent so his stability and kindness felt foreign to me but I didn’t realize that I was self sabotaging at the time. We kept in touch and talked all the time ever since. It never worked out between us to get back together. We went to universities on opposite sides of the country and when I as single he was dating someone and vice versa.

He ended up getting engaged. We still continued to talk even right after he got married. I called him a few times because I was going through a health crisis and he was lamenting to me that he couldn’t believe he was married. I noticed after after our last call that he unfollowed me on all social media and even though it was unspoken I knew his wife didn’t want us talking so I respected that and unfollowed him and ceased contact. However I was in complete survival mode due to my health issues so it never really fully registered with me that our relationship was over.

Two years later I noticed he watched one of my instagram stories and I started thinking about him again even though I was (and still am) in an amazing relationship. I started stalking his wife on Instagram and comparing myself to her more than I’d like to admit. Then recently I got a new number and reached out to him under the guise of pranking him. He knew who it was immediately and after some friendly banter I thought that was it. But then the next day I get a text from a random number and he tells me that he can’t talk to me because it causes problems with his wife but he still thinks highly of me and wishes we could keep talking etc. I apologized and told him that I didn’t want to cause issues for him and that was that.

It’s been a month since that exchange and I’ve been ruminating about it ever since. Yesterday I noticed he watched one of my stories on Instagram and it just fueled the fire. What’s difficult for me is that I’ve had closure with every other guy I’ve dated. I’ve hung out with them after our relationship ended and it confirmed that I didn’t want to be with them, but I never had that that with this guy. Also the fact that we were friends and talked over the course of several years is arguably more intimate than other relationships I’ve had but I never fully realized that until recently.

I don’t want to be a home-wrecker and I think I’m just holding a torch for no reason. I mean it’s been six years since we have seen each other in person so we could be completely different people anyway. Should I let it go? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - Ex and I kept in contact for many years but then had to stop when he got married. I hit him up recently as a friend but it seems it ignited feelings for both of us. Should I let it go once and for all?",relationships
"This has been bothering me for months now, and after a particularly dumb argument tonight I Just don't know where else to go. This is my first post here and I'm new to reddit in general. For some background info we've lived together for a year now and have been together for 2.5 years. I'm currently unemployed because of the pandemic (but still paying rent to him bcuz he owns the house) and he's working from home. Because of my abundant free time I've been cooking him food - breakfast and dinner, and making smoothies for the both of us practically every day. He's made me pancakes a couple times I believe over the past month or two. 

So today for breakfast I went the extra mile and made french toast and bacon and delivered it to him and then made us smoothies later in the day. By dinner I was getting kind of a headache so I laid down on the couch and was rubbing my eyes and asked him, ""Have you had dinner yet?"" He replied, ""I had a sandwich, but I'd be down for some vegetable soup."" I then asked him, ""Would you want to heat some up for the both of us?"" He immediately replied, ""No."" So I asked, ""Why not?"" And he said, ""because I don't want to."" I then decided to get up and heat myself a bowl and said if he wanted to heat himself up some I'd leave it out on the counter. At this point I was pretty upset, but calm, and told him I was going to go watch TV in the bedroom. He asked if I was mad and although I rly didn't feel like talking about it, I told him yes because when I ask him to do anything for me he gets mad or defensive (and trust me I don't ask for things often at all because this is generally how he acts unless I'm sick/have a migraine). He replied with, ""So I should just do anything you ask of me?"" I was like, ""No, but I'm kinda getting a headache and thought you could do that for me."" I then decided I didn't want to argue and went to the room. I cry really easily so I had started to and just wanted to drop it... 

I just feel like if I didn't ask for the occasional thing here or there he would virtually do nothing for me and our house would be so disgustingly dirty or I'd end up doing it all. We've kind of had arguments like this in the past over chores because I'm a cleaner person than him  and I get rly anxious when dishes pile up and when I ask him to do them he's said, ""Why don't you just do them if they're bothering you?"" And I'm like, why would I do them when they're all yours or our roommates, I'm not your maid! I had started hand-washing all of my dishes because I didn't want them to be a part of the mess and so everyone else's dishes pile up for a week before I mention it to him to which he always gets an attitude about it  before doing them. We did make the vegetable soup together and I asked if he would empty the dishwasher (of all his and our roommates dishes bcuz I handwash all mine) so I could fill it with the dishes we dirtied making the soup and he got rly standoffish about that too. 

TLDR; my BF told me he didn't want to heat some soup up for me after I had done things for him all day. I just want to know, it is okay to ask your partner to do things for you right? Whether it be chores or small things around the house. Because I always question myself and if I should be upset over things like this. He believes these are expectations I'm putting onto him when I shouldn't be.",relationships
"**Long post warning, if you read this I just want to say thank you in advance**

EDIT: Should've mentioned I [M26] 

**Backstory:**

My best friend, lets call her A, met in college and we had been friends since then.  We were complete opposites but we compliment each other extremely well.  We had same career goals, same ambitions and I never met anyone like her.  So we vibed incredibly well.

Over the 5+ years, the topic of relationships would be brought up. Not necessarily between us but relationships in general.  I told her I dont like commitment because it slow down goals, and she agreed.  I remember the conversation well because she asked me if I will ever commit to someone and I said, yes ofc.  If shes the right girl, if shes enough, I will say enough is enough and commit.  And she agreed.  *This is going to be an important moment as I will mention it later in this post*.

Eventually, we hooked up and it became a frequent thing.  Things became different, our normal hang outs turned into ""dates"" and I should've spoke up but I didnt.  And she told me she loved me and I freaked out and said the same thing.  I should've said something and clear the situation but Idk I didnt.  I really had feelings for her but at the time, I wasnt sure about everything and it felt fast.

Anyways one day she caught me talking to another girl and everything blew up.  In the heat of the moment, I told her that we were never a couple and I never asked her to be my gf (which is true) and I brought up the fact that we both had the same view about commitment.  In which she replied that she thought she was enough, she thought she was the right girl etc.

Basically, in the end I was accused of lying, leading her on, breaking her trust.  And she said we couldnt be friends anymore or anything.  I was upset because she was throwing 5+ yrs of friendship over a mixup of communication and I left.

**Flash forward for about a year**

I literally left.  Got a great traveling gig for my career, explored so many great places, met amazing people etc. I met a girl and she became like a best friend to me (lets call her B).  I hear back home that A, is doing well, dated a guy for a month, great career advancement so I thought, at least we're both doing fine.

Then I got my dream job back home and moved back.  I attended a wedding of mutual friends of A and I and for the first time in almost a year and I saw her.  We exchanged quick hi's and that was it.  B was my plus one that night and from the quick exchange I had with A, it really seemed that she moved on and was happy.  Deep down, I wanted to say how much I missed her, how sorry I am etc but I didnt.

**Flash forward a couple of weeks**

I dropped off a mutual friend at her apartment after a night out and I saw A.  I took the moment to say sorry but before I even was able to get into it, she stopped me.  She said I dont have to say sorry, she understands that she was never enough for me.  She says that she was nothing but a study buddy and a fuck buddy to me.  She said that I have a new best friend now (referring to B) and moved on so shes happy for me. She mentions how the past year has been tough on her because of the situation between us and the fact that her parents have been fighting, relatives passing away etc  She told me that it sucks cause she hates that she still has feelings for me but before I could say anything back she said goodbye and closed her door. 

And we just left from there.  Since then, I've been tossing and turning about the whole situation.  **On the most basic level, I failed as a friend.  I feel guilty because how can I ever make my best friend question her self worth.  And whats worse is over the course of the year when she was hurting, I wasnt there.  I didnt text her.  I didnt apologize.  I didnt call her.  I ghosted her.**

I have feelings for her too but I didnt say it cause Idk.  At the very least I at least want to be in her life again cause I deserted her for a year when she needed me.  But Idk where to start.

I spoke to B about it but she told me to forget about A.  Theres no point turning back in time and I have her now.

But I cant forget about A lol just dont know what to do now...

#TL;DR: Kinda fucked up with my best friend.  Hurt her feelings which led to question her self worth.  She admitted to still having feelings for me and I do too - where do I go from here?  At the minimum, I at least want to repair the friendship.",relationships
"My ex and I dated for 8 months. It was very easy going, passionate, and we traveled a ton (cheap trips). We broke up when he moved away for a permanent and much higher paying job a few states away. The main issue was that he was quite serious in some ways, so I kept my sillier humour to friends and watched silly TV by myself, though we still had plenty of laughs. This worked well, and I felt like the relationship was deeper for it.

I'm finishing my PhD and will need to start applying for jobs across the country soon. Luckily, it's quite employable so I'm not worried about finding a job, and will have my pick of a few states. I've been having a bit of a crises because of this. My boyfriend is willing to follow me and I have doubts (even before my ex).

My current boyfriend I've been with for 7 months, and we've been quasi-living together for a couple months. There are a few issues that have been present throughout. Recently I've been considering breaking up, but have held back because the relationship is mostly good, he's my best friend, and he loves me a lot. The main issues are that we bicker a fair bit, we don't have any overlapping passions (I'm really into fitness and have a few zero waste hobbies that he has no interest in and are fairly essential to me), and I'm not as attracted to him as I'd like to be in a partner. We're very silly together, and have a ton of fun and similar life goals, but sometimes he feels like more of a brother-figure than a romantic partner. Sometimes the humour is mean-spirited.

My ex knew I was considering moving away from my current state, and recently sent a message asking if I'd ever consider moving to his state (this is 10 months after our break-up, with occasional platonic catch-up messages since), that he missed me, and that he thought of me often and wished he'd considered long distance. We never spoke about the possibility of LDR and this was fairly out of the blue. We never got to the ""I love you"" stage, whereas my boyfriend and I got there quite soon, despite my doubts. 

And now my heart hurts and I don't know what to do. My boyfriend is my best friend and we mostly get along wonderfully. But sometimes I miss the passion and calming presence of my ex, even before he messaged me. I'd say I'm 70% happy with my boyfriend, but I sometimes want more. Is that too much?

**This is more about my current relationship than my ex. How do I decide if breaking up is right, when he loves me, is serious about me, we get along fantastically, and is mostly a good guy?**

**TL;DR: My ex who moved away wants to do long distance, I'm in a new serious relationship, but have quite a few doubts and don't know if I should breakup with my ""new"" boyfriend.**",relationships
"We met back in high school and we're the kind of friends who don't usually text each other (except birthdays, achievements, or just replying to stuff on social media) but I got to say that I always felt slightly attracted to her.

As of lately I started going through old pictures, videos, and old texts and I felt those shivers you get when you find out you're attracted to someone. However there's a big problem: she's also the best friend of a girl (21F) I dated for a long time (I knew of their relationship for I met them at the same time), even though we are still friends but went our separate ways.

I actually think our friendship is strong enough to endure my confession but for some reason I'm still scared if something goes wrong. How could I confess my feelings?

I believe I have been at this loop for a while and I'm not antisocial, all of the few people I've met with traits i find attractive are are either already in a relationship or looking towards someone opposite of me so I'm really out of ideas and starting to believe I'm broken somehow. Friends around me like me a lot and it would seem that I'm not a bad person, so i cannot understand why the only people that have  love interest in me are completely out of my tune, and I'm pretty sure the way i act wasn't supposed to be attractive to them.

"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice about how to handle a coworker of mine hitting on my boyfriend in a polite way that won't create anymore drama. Any advice would help since I'm not that experienced when it comes to relationships. Also, I'm new to Reddit so please let me know if I'm not posting this in the right place. Thanks in advance.

I \[F, 20\] have worked with my boyfriend, N \[M, 23\], for two years but we have been dating for about six months. It's been really great- it's the first long term relationship I've had and N is an amazing man who I'm head over heels for. I don't think I've felt this away about anyone else. However, our coworker A \[F, 23-25\] has been blatantly flirting with him for the past couple months while being cold/rude to me whenever we work together. N has mentioned to her that she is making him uncomfortable but she hasn't stopped. About a month ago he reported her to HR but nothing seems to have been done about it. She clings to him whenever they work together, ""playfully"" touches him, and apparently tries to put me down whenever they work together. According to my coworkers and N, he sticks up for me and has flat out told her to back off but she hasn't stopped. Apparently she has tried to spread rumors about me to my other coworkers who luckily have my back and have also stuck up for me. I either try to politely dismiss her by just being completely matter of fact with her or just straight up ignore her but it doesn't seem to work. N and I have talked about this several times over the past couple months and with her not listening to us and HR not doing anything I kind of feel at a loss of how to handle this.

"TL;DR, 
Here's my problem. Me (26f) and girlfriend(32f) have been having issues with our relationship to the point she says she cries in the shower, etc. Last night I came home after being gone for a couple days to celebrate an event without her. But I promised I would be home in time to spend some time with her. By the time I got home I was so tired. I didn't want to stay up much longer. I know I know I'm in an asshole for that. There's a story to why I came home late. Well anyway, we went to bed and woke up a few hours later than started talking about different things. I opened up to her a little (mind you that was hard, I'm not good at this). So I thought by the end of the conversation we were better than we have been. 

Today, she asks me if i ever posted on here about her. Which I have the day before I went on my trip actually. I told her I have and she obsessed about trying to find my post. Or getting me to send it to her. I told her if she finds it than she finds it. I'm just not going to send it to her. I needed to vent and even if it sounded stupid on here. Because I'm not good with words. I didn't want to stupid to her or mix up my words to the point that she takes it a different way because she overthinks everything. Back to the point here, after a while. She just acted upset because I didn't want to willingly let her read what I wrote even tho I was vented. So she got upset that vented to a bunch of strangers (who have no idea who I am and even if y'all judge me or her. It won't matter because it can't hurt my feelings the way she could me. Does that make sense?) Instead of venting to her. It's easier to vent on here for that reason I said above. 

I decided to leave her alone and not bug her while she's obsessing with finding this other post. I'm playing on my phone or watching TV not paying a damn attention to anything or anyone else. I finally go in the room to tell her what our dog did. And asked if she took a shower without me. It was instant attitude ""did you not hear the shower? But yes I can't cry in the shower with you in there"" I said noi didn't hear it. (I know if I ask why she was crying she's going to say ""it doesn't matter""),  I asked her if she ate yet today and her response was ""are you really not paying that much attention to me that you don't know what I have done today"" like wtf is happening here.",relationships
"Sorry for the long post but my (F28) boyfriend (M30) has a single female friend (F50) who he has been friends with for 10 years. My boyfriend and I have been friends for 2 years and dating now for a year and a half now. So he’s known her longer than he’s been with or known me. 

He likes to mountain bike and run and so does she. That’s how they met. She lives out of state and he’s visited her in the past to mountain bike since we live in a flat state with no mountains. They both even traveled to a country neither one lives in to mountain bike and shared an Airbnb having separate rooms.

At first I was okay because they’ve been friends for 10 years and have a passion for mountain biking. Plus she’s 20 years older than him. If you’re thinking “there’s young guys that are into older rich women”, she’s not rich and he is a lot more well of than she is. 
While I truly don’t think my boyfriend fancy’s her, I believe she is very much into him and she’d jump on an opportunity to get in his pants. 

She does things such as heart liking his pictures on Facebook, posting comments on his pictures with fire emojis, heart emojis and kissing faces emojis and comments like “you’re so badass”  
At first I thought she was a very supportive friend but now it’s gotten to the point where it makes me super uncomfortable and I find it downright rude and disrespectful towards me and my relationship with him. 

However I feel he encourages her towards this behavior. He has started conversations to her with “hey sexy” which I confronted him about. I told him that I didn’t like that he was calling her that and that it was encouraging her to be obsessing over all his social media posts. He laughed and said “I’m just saying that to be nice.” I told him he wouldn’t find it very nice if I called another guy “sexy” regardless of age. He agreed with me on that and said he was sorry and wouldn’t say things like that to her anymore. I had not seen any messages sent to her or her to him that would indicate they had any sort of sexual relation. 

Now I have met this woman in person twice. Once when she was visiting our town and another when we were visiting her town. She seemed over the top nice. Like constant slap happy to the point it feels forced. But I was nice to her because I had no reason at the time to dislike her and because she was a good friend of my boyfriends. We are friends on Facebook and I like her posts from time to time because I like to show my support to his friends plus I do like some of the things she posts. She’d be pretty awesome if I didn’t feel she was drooling after my mans knob. However I noticed she doesn’t really like any of my posts unless he’s in the picture....

I recently tried ending our relationship because I felt we had different goals in our lives, however he kept telling me we didn’t have to end our relationship because of it, kept telling me how much he missed me, some of my friends told me I should give him more time, etc. So I decided to give our relationship some more time. 

A couple days after deciding to continue with our relationship, I decided to look at the text messages on his phone to see if he wasn’t messaging anyone during our break like he said he wouldn’t. (Before we split he told me “I want us to stay together, I won’t text or see anyone else because I only want to be with you”.) we stayed split for a week before I decided to give it another chance. 
I noticed he had messaged his female friend (50) about our split. Now mind you, she had messaged him a couple days into our split just to chat about life and he proceeded to tell her that we split and why. First she said she was sorry for him and then proceeded to tell him “Good for you for not allowing people to manipulate you into doing things you don’t want to do” 
To clarify: at some point, I’d like to get married, settle down and have kids. He’s not ready for that and not sure he ever wants to get married. He’s okay with having kids at some point but doesn’t want to legally get married due to his parents very bad marriage and eventual divorce. Which was also really bad. 
He believes two people can be happily in love and together forever without being binded by legal papers. 
I didn’t want him to feel forced or have to change his life for me if that was what he didn’t want, hence leading to our split. Which I explained to him nicely. My friends said I should give him more time to warm up to the idea. Friends of mine that have known him longer (since college days) than I have says he’s changed a lot for the better since he’s been with me and that he needs more time. 

Never have I ever tried to manipulate him into getting married. Which is why I found it very rude coming from someone (of the opposite sex who is single) to be telling him as if I was manipulating him. I have always been very honest with him from the beginning before we became a couple, telling him I date for the purpose of getting to know someone with the intention of one day getting married. He said he understood and it was something he would consider later in the future. Right now he is focused on having a business/career to be able to support children, etc. he is very business motivated and always working on his two businesses and future business plans. The only thing he makes time for asides from working is me and mountain biking/running. 

So my question, given everything I mentioned, am I right for having this feeling of threat from her or am I overreacting? How would I go about it being they’ve been friends for 10 years? Should I talk to her about it or just not do anything?

TL;DR! 
My (F28) boyfriend (M30) has a single friend (F50) who shows waaay too much interest in him through social media and text.",relationships
"my bf and his ex are still friends and he has reassured me before he no longer has a romantic interest in her due to the nature of how their relationship ended, because i’ve expressed my insecurity about it before. it first happened a week or so ago where she made a post degrading her appearance and he commented something along the lines of “no no, stop that, you’re gorgeous”.

it hurt my feelings at first but then i realized i may have been a bit ridiculous because just cause you break up with someone doesnt mean you want them to hate themselves right? however it happened again recently where she made another post of similar nature and he said something like “why do you dislike your appearance?” maybe i am just overreading into it but it just feels partially disrespectful to me in some way even though she IS pretty. the thing is, we call our friends cute and other strangers we find in public cute and what not but when it’s an ex... it just feels different and a little insensitive of him. but i don’t know if i’m just overreacting or not.

i want to talk to him about it but i don’t want him to think i’m distrusting of his reassurances before or that i’m just being overly dramatic by reading too much into something. what should i do? should i be concerned at all?

"Hi all, thank you for reading.

I have been dating ‘Veronica’ for 5 months. It’s a great relationship. We never argue, laugh a lot, have a great sex life and I adore her. I have never been as in love as I have with her. 

Before Veronica I dated my ex, Ellen, for 4 years. We broke up 1,5 year ago. After a year of not talking, Ellen, who is seeing someone, and me have been cordial and starting to develop a friendship. We can once a week and before the lockdown, thought about meeting up, as friends. My relationship with Ellen has always been more of a friendship than a love relationship. I don’t think I was ever very in love with her, but I did love her.


Veronica doesn’t mind this, which makes me glad. I know I should be very grateful. 
Since Ellen was my only long term relationship, I sometimes tend to compare it with the one I have with Veronica.

Veronica has been cold since we had a small argument a few days ago. She had told her mother (who she rarely sees) about her relationship with me and just didn’t seem al that enthousiastic about it. Or sometimes when I can’t come over cause I work late she will say ‘Ok no problem, honey’ and it feels like she doesn’t miss me? 

I told her that surely I didn’t understand because I was used to the complicity I had with Ellen and that I should get used to not having that with Veronica at the moment. 

She told me this hurt and that she is tired of hearing about the complicity I had with Ellen.

I am not sure if I did something wrong? And how should I make things better?

"I hadn’t had my first kiss until about a week ago. That seems pretty late, but he was cool with it. Things actually went really well and heated up. So much so, he made it to third base and started fingering me. I really just wanted him to rub, so I moved his hand. He wasn’t understanding. So afterwards, I was asking him about it, and he said he didn’t know that that’s how most women came (he’s had a couple girlfriends that he’s thought he made come too). The second time, I tried guiding him and he still didn’t get it

"I have explained multiple times to my partner of 7 years that having sexing 8 times per year makes me feel worthless, unsatisfied and depressed.  She absolutely refuses to have this conversation like an adult an ensures it derails immediately.  I have attempted to bring this up nearly 40 or so times over the past few years.  She absolutely will not commit to making changes.  I have even stated ""If you just don't find me attractive or enjoy me, then please let me know so we can move on.""

Nothing seems to work.  I am not a sex addict, but a regular sex life with my adult partner doesn't seem to be a strange desire to have.

I moved to a different country to live with her and have been here for years at this point.

This has resulted in me resenting my partner, I love her and she is a very nice person but even her prescence is starting to upset me.  The quarantine isn't helping either, as I work remotely and now she is home all the time. 

tl;dr

My partner knows how upset our sexless relationship is, she refuses to change and I know she won't, I love her but I'm absolutely miserable.  It disgust me she knows how much pain this causes me but she refuses to help resolve that pain.  This makes me feel worthless.

""I know you are suffering.  I could resolve it but I won't even though I know it harms you.  Also, you can't have sex with anyone else, even though I won't have sex with you anyway.""

"Hello need some advice,

I met my friend 2 years ago and we quickly spent every week together. She started calling me her best friend but I didn't feel like that really. The relationship progressed as we spent a lot of time at the beginning. We were both in tumultuous relationships. I left my partner last year finally and I feel like I'm growing healthier mentally after years.

However, she's still having trouble with her relationship and I don't think he's good for her. That's not the least of the problem though. I feel a weird sense she is always competing with me and it makes me feel uncomfortable and she even admits she's insecure. Sometimes I try to be vulnerable about a situation and say how I am not feeling too good about something and she pipes up she can't relate because she has no problem with it or I'll say how I'm struggling with something and she'll say how she doesn't have any issue with that. I am looking from support from her too by being vulnerable but instead she makes it a competition. We can never have a conversation -- where she asks me questions. I feel like I listen to her most of the time. Also we hang out every week and I feel obligated to and I told her once when I feel overwhelmed I need alone time and she says...no don't do that to me... but I'd like to be able to only hang out every 2 weeks so I have my own time. I have a lot on my plate and I just need lots of alone time as an introvert. She gets in fights with her bf every weekend and I think she almost uses me as a way to socialize to feel better to get away from him and talk about it since he doesn't let her have male friends. I just want a healthy relationship and I don't know why but recently I feel uncomfortable talking to her because I wonder whenever she shares good news if it's coming from a genuine place or a place of insecurity.

Lastly, the thing another problem is she tells me secrets and other people's business constantly. Like her sister sent something and she showed me the texts which her sister told her not to specifically show anyone. She has also spilled all my relationship drama to her other best friend I don't know too well and I don't know how to feel about it. I felt a little annoyed but didn't know how to bring it up that she was sharing my private conversations with this other friend. I like her in other ways but I don't want to trust her anymore as someone I can tell things to if that makes sense. Sigh, I don't know what to do because I've already called her best friend but don't want to be as close now that I know her better. I just want to do the fun stuff but not be vulnerable about my life.

Note:She already has abandonment issues because her last best friend stopped talking to her completely out of the blue and she still holds anger and resentment from it. So I feel incredibly conflicted and worry about backlash as I am not a confrontational person(I get anxious about it).

Hello! My bf and I have been together for about 2 years, he's extremely loyal and a great communicator, we've grown a lot together and he's an overall amazing partner. We're separated for quarantine, which freaking sucks on many levels, but for the most part we've been toughing it out. He lives in a house with five other guys, and there's been a (very beautiful) woman (24ishF) crashing on their couch for the entire shelter in place order. Lately every time we FaceTime, his hair (which is very long, like chest length), is in some elaborate braid that this girl has done for him. At first, it didn't bother me, but the more it happened and the more I thought about some girl running her fingers through my partner's hair for hours on end, the more it bothered me. There's something intimate about braiding hair; from the whole fingers in hair thing, to having to lean into someone to let them do it, and it's starting to genuinely irk me that another woman is having these experiences with my partner when I can't. It really drove me up the wall when he missed one of our planned phone calls, and then told me the next day it was because he was getting his hair braided.

I don't consider myself a jealous person, I'm secure enough in my relationships that women flirting etc doesn't normally get to me. So I guess I just want some perspective here, I'm not used to feeling this way. Am I being crazy, or can the extreme emotional duress of quarantine justify me asking my boyfriend to stop this behavior? I will gladly accept responses telling me to calm down, i think we all need that sometimes. Please help me understand my own emotions!!!!

"TLDR: I (24F) met my boyfriend, David (28M), bc he is a close friend of my sister Bri's (26F) boyfriend Nate (29M). Now, when Nate wants to hang out with David, my sister is upset that I'm automatically invited to their stuff.

Context: Bri and I have both known Nate since we were teens, he's always been closer to my sis Bri than me, but I consider him a friend and have known him for a long time before they started dating.

My sister came to my city w/ friends for NYE and invited me. I met up with them at their airbnb where I met David, my now boyfriend, for the first time. He lives in my city but is close friends with my sister's bf from childhood.

Bri asked me what I thought of David that night, I said he was hot, she warned me to be careful because if anything happened with me and David that he's so close to her bf (like brothers) that he'd always be around. After she said the same thing a few more times over the course of the night/next day, I told her ""Hey, no problem, if you're telling me not to talk to David, I won't."" and she said ""No, no that's not what I mean, I'd never say that, just be careful"" and we left it at that.

I was invited by Bri's to go on a friends trip with everyone a few weeks from then, and we were all excited.

I start sleeping with David between NYE and the trip.

Possibly asshole-y, I was avoidant and didn't want to discuss my sex life with my sister, esp because it's not a thing I would normally do and we hadn't had the ""what are we doing talk yet"", so I didn't. I knew she had heard it through the grapevine, but I didn't address it with her personally.

On the trip I did put my hand on his leg a few times and we slept in the same bed. It was obvious we were together, but still me and Bri didn't discuss it.

The trip from mine and David's perspective was great, and eventually started dating officially.

When I got home from the trip, Bri called very, very angry with me. She said I was loud, fake, and clout chasing the whole time, that I had to have attention on me, taking over HER friends trip, I was flirting with her OTHER friend Crystal (Bri and Nate's poly relationship's 3rd), I was selfish/uncaring towards her feelings, I made a fool of myself and she can't trust me around her friends and that I made something that was supposed to be a fun trip frustrating and stressful due to my carelessness.

We had long conversations about what happened, I had no clue she felt all those things and was horrified that I made such an ass of myself. She told me I shouldn't to talk to her friends, was pissed that I hadn't considered her when I chose to start seeing David, bc now she feels like she has no say in whether or not I hang out with her group of friends/boyfriend, and that I'll either always be around or she has to seem like the ah that doesn't want me there when David does and Nate wants to see David because they're like brothers, but that she doesn't want me there.

So, am I acting completely out of step or is she being unreasonable?",relationships
"TL;DR! My boyfriend has consistently lied to me for the last 2.5 years and has recently been putting no effort into the relationship. Is it time for me to leave? 

It’s been a very long road leading up to me making this post. I met my boyfriend in the late winter/early spring of 2018. When we first went out I was stunned by how handsome and kind he was and how much we hit it off. I truly thought I may have hit the jackpot and possibly found the one. After 2 months of dating I asked him if he thought he was looking for something serious (or at least long-term) and said I might have to walk away if he wasn’t because I was starting to have really strong feelings for him, and he assured me that he did want that. 

After that talk, things between us started to ramp up, but I started noticing red flags. He didn’t want me around his family, he consistently hid me from his friends, and he would go days without talking to me (which he chalked up to being ADHD and forgetting to respond). Then when he would see me he would act like it was the only he had been looking forward to. Still, the red flags persisted. At one point, within the span of 2 weeks there were two separate incidents in which I found women’s underwear that wasn’t mine in his room because his dog likes to eat underwear and would find it and take it to his bed which was usually pretty visible in the room. His excuse for this was that he used to keep underwear from girls he slept with in high school and he had forgotten about the stash until the dog found it. I can’t explain to you people why I believed him, but I did. He also had a female friend that he didn’t tell me about who he would go out and get drunk with or take to hang out with his friends instead of me. By the time I found out about her he said he didn’t want to introduce us because of my negative feelings towards her. I ignored all of these signs primarily because we had such a great time when we were together. 

6 months in to the relationship we moved in together. This was admittedly a bad decision from the start purely due to my motive in moving in with him. I wanted to wait, but my mom ended up randomly moving to a different state which made it difficult for me to continue to pay rent by myself, so when he said he wanted to move in together I felt like I had no choice. The roommate I got after my mom left was awful and I didn’t really know how I would be able to make enough money to support myself. I was also extremely nervous and spent a lot of time talking to him about whether or not he was ready. I was extremely concerned with whether or not he was complete enough as a person to enter a full year lease with, but he persisted that he loved me and was ready to start paving the way to our future. So, against better judgement, I moved in with him (please keep in mind I had JUST turned 18, so there was definitely naivety at play). 

For the first few months everything was perfect. Honeymoon phase to the MAX. Sex multiple times a day, I made dinner every night, we had both just started new jobs and he was finishing school. But then... one day he stopped wanting to have sex with me. He would spend all of his time in our home office with the lights off and doors shut, often shutting off his phone or computer screen when I walked in the room. He began to get very mad at me when I would ask him to come to bed, or spend any time with me at all. Through all of this, I had caught and asked him about pictures of other women on his phone and instagram page. He continually called me “crazy” and would find any angle he could to gaslight me into thinking I really was crazy and wasn’t seeing those things. One day we were in the office and I knew I had seen it for sure. The same routine began as usual. He called me crazy, said I was seeing things, that my “daddy issues” were out of control, and then turned his attention back to his computer monitor. I sat in a chair behind him with tears filling my eyes and literally thought to myself, “He’s right. You’re fucking crazy. You’re a no-good, paranoid bitch and you’re seeing things. You’re probably schizo. You’re crazy.” And then it’s like a switch flipped. In a single split second it hit me like a ton of bricks. I went from “he’s right” to “Why am I letting someone tell me I didn’t see something I know I saw? Why am I letting him *convince* me that I’m crazy when I’m not?” I stood up and demanded that he show me his phone. I said I knew I wasn’t crazy and that the jig was up. I wanted to see the girl. 

Boy, was that a fucking mistake. 

He pleaded with me not to look and said I would be mad. To this day, I don’t know why he thought “you’ll be mad” was going to be a deterrent. I found over 10,000 pornographic images on his phone in a single folder. He admitted to me that he viewed multiple times a day for hours a day and that he had hid the addiction from me because he knew it was wrong. I wasn’t originally going to add this, but I’m a half-asian female and all of the porn was of full-blown asian girls. This was especially devastating as he had told me he didn’t have an asian fetish and additionally wasn’t dating me for my race and insisted that I didn’t look asian at all when we started dating. It offended me then when he would say that, but after I found the porn it felt like he used the porn because I wasn’t asian enough. 

That whole situation broke me. He had treated me as second best to girls he didn’t even know for months, and I couldn’t break up with him because I had nowhere safe I could stay and no money to live on my own. In the months following, I lost 25 lbs and became extremely depressed. I also got pregnant and lost a baby during that time which was obviously no help. 

About 6-8 months after that, our relationship really hadn’t gotten much better. We took a beach vacation and I was sick and instead of supporting me for still trying to have fun, he yelled at me multiple times claiming that I wanted to be sick and was purposefully ruining our vacation. He also told me I had a fat face when I was trying on sunglasses in a random shop we stopped into. At the end of our vacation he got so mad at me for being sick that he dropped me at our airbnb and disappeared for 6 hours. During the time he was gone, I called my mom and made arrangements to leave, no matter the cost. I told him when he got back that night and I left our apartment 3 weeks later. 

After I moved we did long distance, broke up, and then got back together. I moved back in with him despite the fact that he was originally supposed to move in with me, and the lies just continued. He was really mean to me for seeing someone else during our breakup, but there were other women’s underwear in his apartment when I moved in, as well as other proof of dates he’d been on. Even though I had underwear and literal receipts, he had refused to admit that he saw someone while we were broken up. This wouldn’t bother me and he knows that, so now I kinda think it happened while we were together. Anyways, due to these issues, I moved out again and back to my home state for some space. This brings us to where we are now. 

He wants to move to my home state and to make things work in our relationship, but still continuously lies. He also doesn’t want to talk to me often and recently said he would go so far as to break up with me if I texted him more often than I currently do. He’s also made no efforts to make any sort of moving plans (i know this is hard with covid but it’s still possible to work around) and all I want is to know that he wants this and will work for it as hard as I will. I want to believe he wants us to work because he gets so sad when I leave and he does try to make me happy in ways he knows how to, but I’m starting to feel like an idiot for loyally standing by someone through lie after lie, problem after problem, when that someone wouldn’t stand by me if I sent one too many text messages. 

Is it safe to say I should walk away? Should I wait to see if he actually cares and is willing to put work in? Or has he already shown me that he won’t?

Edit: Rereading this I just want to add that I have struggled with paranoia and being a little difficult since some of the more serious situations in our relationship have happened. I haven’t been perfect in how I’ve handled some of these situations and I’m fully willing to recognize and own my fault in some of the failings of this relationship.",relationships

I’m just wondering how people handle their partner’s sleeping habit when their’s don’t correspond to yours. For instance, you normally sleep at 9pm (25F)but my partner (28M) sleeps at 2am. Been with this guy for 5 months but it just lately it has been bothering since I enjoy getting snuggled to sleep and waking around the same time as my partner. However that isnt the case.  I wake up at 7am and he wakes up at 12pm. I talked to him about it. He tried to sleep at the same time as me for a few days and eventually he went back to his old habit. Am i just being childish about this? When i do try to get him to sleep at similar time with me, he gets fussy and tells me how I’m restricting him and gets upset.  He just stays up to play games every single day. What do you guys think?

I don't want to hold him back from his goals and career, but I hate talking or thinking about it. He says he'll fly down to see me and he'll fly me up to see him every 2 weeks. But he doesn't seem upset about the long distance thing.

A part of me wants to end it to avoid getting in any deeper. But things have been so good and I can't see myself with anyone else.

Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to survive or prepare for long distance?

TL;DR boyfriend is going to grad school in another state in a year, unsure about how long distance is gonna work out for 2 or 3 years",relationships
"Throwaway bc this is kind of embarrassing and also they occasionally browse Reddit.

As the title says, they are mad at me because, even though they try to give me blowjobs, they do not get me to orgasm. Personally i really do enjoy getting blowjobs but as much as they try, my partner cannot get me to cum in their mouth.

I don't feel like this is much of an issue, but every once in a while they get upset with me because of it. ""Any other guy would want to cum in their partner's mouth"" and ""I'm just not good enough for you."" It's frustrating because they blame it on me even though i don't really have any control of it. What am i even supposed to do?

The rest of our sex life has been fantastic. Not so much now since the virus, but when we hung out before the quarantine we were both very satisfied with eachother besides this.

If you guys can come up with some way to help or something i could them, that would be much appreciated.

TL;DR: My partner can't get me to orgasm through blowjobs and it makes them very upset and they take it out on me.",relationships
"Hey, i [21] recently broke up with my gf [21] , we've been together for 1 year and 4 months, i really loved her and she did too , lately she accused me with lying and insulted me and broke up with me, i tired to clarify things for her that I'm not a lier or anything like that, she was so determined,  
After the break up i started talking to some friends that i wasn't allowed to talk to them when i was with her ( jealousy stuff) when she knew i talked to my old friends (boys and girls especially) she came to me saying that i am a cheater and she didn't except that , i told her they are only friends and they'll always be , and i have no intention to get into any relationship after this break-up, she didn't believe me ,
After some days she came back saying that she want us back together, i said yes me too coz i love her, than she said with only one condition which is my PASSWORD ! Or screenshots about what i talked with my friends , i said she has to trust me and I'm not willing to give you nor my password neither screenshots, she said she doesn't trust my anymore bcoz i talked to some friends after the break up, i said if we are getting back together you should trust me ! We went through some arguments but It finished by ignoring me for days i tried to talk to her she kept ignoring me .
What should i do now ? Is it the end ? If it is how can i go through this break-up , she was my everything and i was really happy with her.

TLDR : my gf broke up with me, and then she came back saying that i cheated on her bcoz i talekd to some friends (girls) after the break up, and she wanted my password to see what I've talked with my friends.",relationships
"My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been together for nearly one year, and have been best friends for 3 years before that.

Our one year anniversary is coming up, and because of COVID restrictions, we can't really do our original plan of going out for dinner. Only takeaway is allowed. 
My boyfriend's plan? We get takeaway and have it in the car... 

I know I really shouldn't be upset, the circumstances are out of our hands, but I can't help feel upset over this. It just seems so mundane. I'm very much about spending time together above all else, but it just seems like there's no effort involved. 

I brought this up with him, and I had the idea of celebrating it at his home. At least indoors, we can watch a movie or play a board game together. The problem is that both of us come from cultural families. In my family, my grandma (who lives overseas but is currently on a visa living with us) is a gossip bug who will tell everyone in her home country that I'm in a relationship if she found out. Living with my parents, it's a huge concern for them, but despite this, they've invited my boyfriend over many times to keep me happy (I'm so grateful for this). 

I've been really upset over my boyfriend not reciprocating this stance. According to his cultural traditions, the girl cannot go to the boy's home until there has been the proposal of engagement or marriage, which isn't going to happen between us for at least another 4-5 years. I'm not asking him to completely let go of his cultural traditions, but I'm starting to feel a bit of inequality in him always coming over to my home, my family making adjustments for him, but him never speaking to his family about letting me come over. He says that he has no power to ask this of his parents (we both still live with our parents), that ""there's no reason for me to come over to his place"" (he said this to me in person), and that according to social norms, the boy always goes to the girl's home.

It's driving me a little mad because he has made so many excuses to come to see me at my home, he's even held off getting printer ink so I can print off his study notes and exam papers and he can come over to meet me. It's all fine and well but it's just so disheartening because I've stood up to my family over some traditions my family has had which was bothering my boyfriend. I fought like hell with my parents to have some freedom from them (we finally got the freedom), and our arguments finally stopped over those traditions. 

I just wish he'd stand up for himself and for us a bit more, and perhaps even consider spending our anniversary at his place for a change. 

Is it unfair to ask him to reciprocate my gestures and have our anniversary at his home? 

Tl;dr: boyfriend wants to spend our one year anniversary in his car, I find it a little disheartening, boyfriend will not reciprocate me standing up against traditions to have some freedom to spend our anniversary at his place.",relationships
"He flirted with literally everyone at work. He openly said he cheated on his wife a decade ago. I’d bet that’s not the only time. It was something he was bragging about. 

He did not hide his advances, for me especially. I was having a somewhat bad period so I clung to his ‘positivity’ and got a crush on him. He hugged me twice, one time in front of co-workers. We foolishly gave him our numbers. We stupidly thought he was friendly and fun to be around. Nothing further happened, although he obviously wanted it, because we started catching up on what he really wanted and feeling uncomfortable, so we put a stop. 

We kept in touch with him on social media after the job was over, like we did with all of our co-workers we were on friendly terms with. I was only playing chess with him, never even talking, while him and my sister (teen but of legal age) would occasionally exchange a ‘hello, how are you’.

Despite that, his wife called my sister, through his online account to my sister’s online account, yelling at her, calling her a slut, threatening her, asking her ‘what business she has with a married man with kids’. My sister was very upset and scared, even though she had done nothing wrong. I was the one his wife should’ve been yelling at.

Turns out his wife is bat shit crazy. Apparently he ’only has male names in his phone’ because his wife doesn’t let him interact with other women at all. But he gives her reasons to do that. I don’t know if I feel bad for her or think both of them were stupid to get married to each other.

After that accident we both blocked him from our social media accounts. We also blocked his number.
We never told our parents because they are very overprotective, conservative and paranoid, and the issue would blow up way more and in a more irrational way than it should. They also grew up in a small community where public opinion is very important. So something like this that might not seem like a big deal to most families, would be really devastating to ours. They have a lot of health problems so we don’t want to stress them unnecessarily.

The work environment itself was toxic. Everyone talked crap behind each other’s backs. An older female co-worker, who is also a manager there and our cousin, warned us that he and his brother are not good people but we learned the hard way. Now we are invited to work again at the same place but we are thinking of saying no.

It’s been many months since we cut contact with them but today my sister got a notification that her phone received a call from a blocked number – and it was his. She’s freaking out, thinking maybe it’s his wife again. And even if it isn’t, why is he calling, provided that we’ve cut contact with him? I’m freaking out because my dad uses my SIM card temporarily and if that asshole decides to call me, the call will be noticed and maybe taken by dad.

I don’t know what to do… I feel extremely stupid. I have talked with my therapist about this and she is helping me move past it. But it seems like this stupid mistake will keep haunting us. How do we get rid of this crazy couple? Can we avoid having to worry our parents? Do we talk with our cousin at the job? Do we contact his brother and ask him to tell his asshole of a brother to stop trying to contact us?

Tldr: married co-worker with kids flirted with us. I briefly flirted back but nothing happened. We cut contact with him after his crazy wife called my sister but now either he or his wife is trying to contact us again.",relationships
"I'll try to keep this short.

My girlfriend and I have been together 8 months. We love each other and there is no doubt about that. My girlfriend already has a 3 yo and she has her every other week. Before I met her, I wasn't planning on having any child but everything changed and we've been trying for two months. Two things happened which lead to this situation.

Firstly, due to confinement, us working from home, and her child's father going back to work, we now have her everyday (only during the day when it's not her week). It's not an easy situation for me I'm not going to lie because the child needs a lot of attention and we're both working during the day, making it really hard for us to concentrate (I'm working as a software Engineer) and also because I miss being just with my girlfriend for a day (when she has her child, she is non-stop taking care of her, which is absolutely normal and I wouldn't want it any other way).

The second thing is, my girlfriend has some health problems which make it very difficult for us to have a child, and in the two months we tried, she had two miscarriage (the last one today). I've been very supportive, she's  feeling guilty and I'm trying my best to tell her how I love her and it's not her fault.

We just had a big discussion with her crying, telling me we should end things because I will never be happy with her and I deserve better, because I will be stuck with her living with someone else child, and she won't be able to give me a child. She has already told me in the past that she thinks she doesn't deserve me and that I should be with someone better.

On my side, I have a great relation with her child, she's a really cool kid, she loves me. I told my girlfriend it's not an easy situation (which is true) but that I'm absolutely ready to make it work, because I love her more than anything. I told my girlfriend I love her, she's the love of my life I truly believe it, I want to marry her and she knows it, I told her I'm happy with her, more than I've ever been in my life, which again is true. I've been supportive and loving with her everyday, especially today with what happened. To make it short, she loves me, I'm the love of her life, I love her, she's the love of my life but she's convinced that because of the whole situation, I won't be happy with her, I don't deserve her and I'll find someone better.

I'm writing this as she's crying in the bed, she doesn't want me to come because she needs to be alone. I sent her the letter I wrote for her birthday, telling her how much I love her and she's making me the happiest man and she told me I should stop hurting her, because she wants us to end even though she loves and it's hard for her to do this.

I don't know what to do anymore, I can't picture myself one day without her.

"My boyfriend and I have known each other since the end of last year, but we've only been dating for a little over a month. I've posted here twice about my developing crush, and I'm glad to say that things are going pretty great so far! We spend a lot of time together, but don't smother each other either, and I really enjoy being with him. 

During one of our conversations recently, though, he said something peculiar that has stuck out to me. I can't recall the exact context, unfortunately, but we were talking about his being a junior in uni and how he managed to get a house off-campus in his sophomore year - which did seemed strange for me, since most people I know weren't able to afford it until junior year at the earliest.

In spite of that, I never really gave much thought to how he afforded the house - he lives in a fairly cheap area, with what I believe are well-to-do parents, and he divides the rent between 3 or 4 roommates (he told me before, but I forgot how many he has). He did have a job, but that ended due to the current circumstances, and to my understanding he is not on unemployment. I always just assumed his parents were covering it for him, but in the course of the conversation, he mentioned that he would tell me once we were together, because it wasn't something that he felt comfortable disclosing over the phone.

That obviously piqued my interest. I laughed and asked what he could possibly be doing to make money that he couldn't say to me over the phone, but he got kind of serious and said he'd prefer to tell me when we meet in person (after everything is reopened, of course). He wasn't angry at the question or defensive at all, but simply stated it was something he didn't want to say over the phone.

I let it go at the time, but as the days have gone on it keeps creeping to the forefront of my thoughts. It's hard for me to imagine many legitimate sources of income that one wouldn't want to disclose through the phone or internet, and I of course immediately rushed to the worst conclusion, that it was something illegal or morally wrong. From what I know about him, that doesn't seem likely, but I can't shake the feeling. 

For a little background, he's a STEM major with no interests or hobbies that I would consider particularly concerning - he drinks semi-regularly and does drugs rarely, with the only drugs I know him to have used being weed (which I also partake of) and a one-time usage of one illicit drug that I think most people would consider to be on on the more ""normal"" end. Regardless, he didn't enjoy it and hasn't tried it again since, by his own admission. So whatever the thing is, I don't believe drugs have anything to do with it.

The only thing I can think is that I know that he uses multiple VPNs, but I honestly don't find that to be suspicious in itself, since using proxies is a good way to keep your online identity secure. However, I am aware that he could be doing so in order to hide any misdeeds.

I guess I'm posting this to sort of have my fears alleviated. Is this a matter I should be pressing, or should I just let it go and wait for him to tell me? He did bring it up of his own volition, and I can't imagine he'd volunteer the information if it was something illegal or wrong, especially given that I had already assumed something else. Regardless, though, it just seemed like a really weird thing to say, and I'm not sure how I should proceed.

TL;DR Boyfriend mentioned that he wanted to tell me in person how he makes his money, but that he didn't want to say it over the phone. I'm worried it might be something bad, but I really can't think of anything of that nature that he could be involved in. Should I push it, or should I wait?",relationships
"My boyfriend and I met at university back in September, but only started dating in February after months of being friends and secretly liking each other. Neither of us had dated before.
Our personalities are quite different: he always tries to act very logically and is a bit of a pessimist, although incredibly humorous and one of the most intelligent people I've ever met. I always act from the heart and try to see the brighter side of things. He's a talker and I'm a listener. Despite our differences, the more we get to know each other, the more we connect and the stronger I feel about him.

The problem came with quarantine. He's never been the best texter, but at university that didn't really matter because we saw each other constantly. Whenever we video call everything feels perfect and normal again, but so much free time has given me time to see our relationship from a different perspective and realise things I used to ignore.

The biggest problem is that he sometimes makes condescending comments. For example, he was a bit tipsy one day after hanging out with his friends. When he came back it was a bit late, he was very affectionate with me but told me that he felt like discussing philosophy with another friend of ours. I told him that our friend was asleep, but he could discuss it with me and wait until the following day to talk with our friend. To this, he replied, 'you just wouldn't understand' and gave me a kiss in the forehead. Now, I am a woman of the sciences, so my knowledge of philosophy is not as broad as his. However, the way he said it made it feel like he thinks I'm stupid. I love learning, so knowing that he may think this about me hurts me deeply. I never mentioned it to him because he was tipsy and don't want to make a big deal out of it.
He's made similar comments over text, although not as directly. Sometimes I express an opinion and he says he thinks it's stupid, but would rather not discuss it because ""it would be too much to explain"".

I can accept the fact that he's not very expressive about his emotions, because I know it's hard for him and he does often tell me how much he loves and appreciates me. And the thought of him ever disappearing from my life is terrifying. However, knowing that he may think I'm intellectually inferior to him hurts me deeply.

I just don't know whether I'm overreacting or not. And if I'm not, is there something I can do?

tl;dr: my boyfriend sometimes makes condescending comments that make it seem like he believes he's intellectually superior to me. However, I don't know whether I'm overreacting or what should I do. I genuinely love him",relationships
"So my(21f) mother (45f) is overweight, but she’s currently healthy and that’s okay. She has arthritis in her knees even though she’s only in her mid 40s and although we don’t know for certain what caused it, it doesn’t run in the family and it’s common knowledge that extra weight causes pressure on the joints. It hinders her mobility quite a bit but she’s otherwise healthy and has no issues. 

She’s been overweight my whole life, I’ve always loved her and accepted her and I always will, it’s never ever been an issue ever. About 4 years ago she lost a significant amount of weight but she has since gained it back. Now during this time she found diet mentality really toxic and wasn’t happy and now she’s accepted herself as the way she is and she’s happy. And of course I’m happy for her too and want her to be confident in herself. 

The only issue is, she’s outspoken and shares a lot of stuff on social media about things that are definitely fatphobia, but also things that just aren’t. I obviously try to be as sensitive as possible as I know how cruel doctors and people have been to her in the past about her weight. However, she acts like anything promoting weight loss (even in perfectly healthy ways) is bad, or shares lots of things saying thin does not = healthy or happy. Obviously that can be totally true, but nobody can say they’re unhappy with the fact they’ve gained weight or wish to lose weight without her calling it harmful or saying “There’s no such thing as a bad food” or some other slogan. She shares lots of things about how it doesn’t matter what you look like as long as you’re happy! Which to be honest, we all know that’s just not always true. I understand there are lots of fat people who are strong and fit, for example Lizzo shakes her ass all night long! However, my mother does not exercise at all. Overweight people can and do suffer health problems related to their weight, that’s no secret, and although we don’t know for certain her weight was a cause, her knees are a prime example. She doesn’t do anything involving walking, climbing etc. I feel like she’s just trying to justify it to herself.

I just find it frustrating that she’s given up all efforts to remain healthy, mobile or lose any weight, basically for the rest of her life it seems. She thinks it doesn’t matter as long as she’s happy and healthy, which would be true if that remained the case, but she eats whatever she wants, whenever. Her only exercise is walking around the supermarket. She’s only in her mid 40s and can’t walk for long distances due to her knees, so she looks set to only gain more weight and be less mobile as she grows older. I’m worried she’s going to develop high blood pressure or other problems (she’s been on BP meds before) and just end up dying prematurely. She’s also incredibly sensitive, if I brought any of this up she’d start bawling and say I’m disgusted with her etc which couldn’t further from the truth. I just can’t sit here and watch my mom say “I’m happy in who I am and accepted I’m fat,” while she simultaneously eats a big tub of ice cream in one sitting and hardly moves all day. Exercise isn’t something you do if you’re thin or trying to get ripped, it’s something you’re supposed to do as a human. I just don’t want to watch her get fatter, become less mobile, and potentially cause other issues as she ages. Any advice??

TLDR; my mother is overweight and healthy, but has totally neglected any ideas of watching what she eats or exercises. This is starting to impact on her mobility and quality of life and I’m worried she’ll only get worse with age.",relationships
"Yeah besically that. We've been together for 3 years, live together and have been enduring the quarantine together these last 2 months. It's quite restrictive where we live, as we can't go out more than once a week. I think he's probably lacking some air, but I also feel like I annoy him all the time . He gives me short answers, talks over me, seems uninterested on what I say, gives me sarcastic replies, etc. Totally passive aggresive ways. 

He's the only one working now and I've been using this time to improve my skills so I can get a good job. I've been unemployed for a couple of years now and it weighs on us. I think that might be what's  bothering him. I feel really self conscious around him. I have been tying to get a job during all this time but you know it isn't easy. I am not even eating more than once a day as I feel ashamed for him spending money on food and me not contributing. 

I don't want to start a fight, I just want to ask him what's wrong and for him to tell me what he needs from me, but he gets very defensive when we argue, so I need help with how am I supposed to address the issue. I need this to go right.

" UPDATE; I broke up with him. Blocked his number and his social media accounts. Thank you all for your feedback and advice! It means a lot. I am beginning to feel a sense of peace and a slight burden lifted off of my shoulders. And for those of you that are suffering, if I can get out of a toxic abusive relationship, so can you.

My boyfriend and I both attend the same college and have been together for 2 years. The last time I saw my boyfriend was around January. He has been distant from me ever since then. I tried to hang out with him and make plans but he’d make excuses. In February, we were supposed to go out for Valentines Day, but he went back home because he was “feeling down”. He actually did go back home but then  he lied to me
about coming back, because he didn’t want me to make plans with him, and I found out. Not to mention I bought him expensive presents and an outfit and made reservations and he just brushed it off. Then around March, he posted a picture with another girl on his Snapchat story around 1 am. When I told him that I wanted to break up with him, he kept lying and saying that I was psycho and that he didn’t post anything. I saw with my own eyes the picture of the girl and him. Then eventually the next day he admitted that he posted a selfie with this girl and that they were friends from school. And that he didn’t want me to know because he know I would flip. But it didn’t seem right. So I didn’t think anything bad about it and I was just blindsided and believed him. But I’m still suspicious till this day. Because he usually tells me about his whereabouts and his friends that are girls and I don’t mind. Then he said after spring break that we could hang out which was around March. Then the corona virus happened and I didn’t get to see him after that at all. But we still talk everyday and keep in contact. But he never wants to FaceTime and our conversations are dry. There are some things that bother me. For starters, I don’t mean to sound crazy but I check his snap score and he leaves me on delivered for hours but his snap score keeps going up. I brought it up to him before and he said that he Snapchat’s his friends &amp; roommates. But before his Snapchat score wasn’t as high as it gets now. So it seems suspicious to me. Also when we do FaceTime sometimes, he puts me on pause and texts other people. When I ask him who it is he says “no one” when I can clearly hear the buzzing and him typing. Then he told me the other day, that his friends don’t know about me. Then he randomly says “Hey I’ll call you back” after receiving a text, but never does. He also constantly calls me psycho and crazy. He also doesn’t say I love you anymore or make the effort to talk to me. It’s always me doing things to get his attention. Sometimes we go Hours without texting
until I message him first. Also not to mention he screenshot my pictures that I posted on my story which he rarely does and when I asked him why he said it’s for memories. And when I say I want to break up with him and talk about our relationship he seems nonchalant and doesn’t seem to care at all. He just says delete my pictures cause you’re psycho. Every time I confront him about something small he calls me crazy. I also feel like he just treats me like” one of the boys, like I’m his friend or something.  if I’m being paranoid but I have had a gut feeling ever since he posted a picture with that girl and stopped seeing me for a while, that he’s cheating on me with her or someone else. I just don’t want to keep wasting my time and emotions and get hurt over someone who treats me like garbage. What should I do?

TLDR; I’m having red flags regrading my 2 year relationship with my boyfriend and I think he’s cheating on me, ever since he posted a Snapchat with another girl. I’m not insecure or psycho but the way he’s been acting for months is bothering me. I don’t know what to do.",relationships
"I've been telling people that I'm bi since high school but this truth is I've never known who I'm attracted to. I have no idea how I'm supposed to eventually figure it out but I think it's likely that that'll take a few more years.

Now, my boyfriend (22m) and I (21f) have been together for three years and lived together for two. He's a wonderful person and he cares about me so much. I've been carrying this uncertainty the whole time and I feel so guilty whenever he's sweet to me, which is all the time. Quarantine never made us fight, it just brought us together and made me so grateful for everything he brings to my life, which is crazy?? We're planning on getting a cat together. We get along like crazy, in a way that I've never experienced before, and I like him more than anyone else I've ever met. It's true that we never had much \*\*sexual electricity\*\* between us but neither of us have high sex drives so it never really mattered. I think he knows on a certain level that I'm not super attracted to him and is okay with that (it's pretty uncommon for me to be attracted to anyone which probably makes it easier on the ego?). Our occasional sex is very chill and loving.

I know that if I'm a lesbian I have to break up with him and stop wasting his time. But I don't KNOW if I'm a lesbian, I just have this sneaking, sinking, feeling, and I don't know what to do? I've thought about an open relationship, but he's not the sort of person who's into the idea of an open relationship and I don't think he'd get a lot out of it. I mean, I  think he'd agree to one if I asked him and made it clear that I was serious, but I think he would hate it. Plus, that ask sort of feels like ""hang tight for a minute while I try having sex with girls to see if I like it more than sex with you"" and that is just HARSH, I don't wanna put him through that. A clean break would probably be kinder to him but I don't want to just break up when I'm not sure about anything. I just don't know how to be sure.

I want to talk to him about this stuff but it also feels cruel, like I'd be asking him to help  me work out whether or not I should break up with him. That just sounds like torture. I don't know how to approach this without putting him through unnecessary pain. I'm terrified of being a lesbian and I'm terrified of losing him.

Is there an option that I haven't thought of yet? How do you think I should go about this? Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before?

Thanks for reading, I can't believe I'm posting my innermost secrets to reddit but here we are. Also, please point me to a better subreddit for advice on this question if there is one (I'm sorta new here).

TLDR there's a chance I'm a lesbian and I need to figure it out while minimizing pain caused to my boyfriend, whom I love very much.

"This has been an issue for me for roughly two months now. All the schools nationwide have been closed since march, and for me this was around the beginning of spring break. What got me (M20) thinking of this issue was seeing so many people graduating, but even more so failing classes like I have.

I was never the best student, but I made it to the second semester of my second year. I worked the bare minimum to reach my desired grade. That said, I was keeping my head above water before the pandemic hit. Enough to where I could relax the whole break. When I had to make the transition to virtual classes, it was impossible for me to focus. I have ADHD, so I decided to move to a spot outside my room to work, but it was so frustrating for me. I couldn't commit to even 20 minutes of work because every few minutes I would get hit with a wave of temptation. Youtube, Steam, the usual vices. It even got to a point where I was reading google recommended articles.

After a few days of trying and finishing maybe 2 assignments, I gave up. I ignored all my classes. My mom(F47) would check up on me from time to time, asking how my studies were. Scared that I'd get an earful from her, I would always say they're fine just different.

It's now that I should mention that college was not the path that I wanted for myself, but my mom's. When I was in high school, I moved in with her to escape from my mentally abusive dad. She made it clear that if I didn't go to college there would be noplace for me in the house. So not knowing what I'd go for, I decided to major in music since it was what I was passionate about at the time. Also, I am a 3rd generation college student on her side, for a bit more context. It's not like she never went.

I have a plan for what I want to do if I ever do drop out, but I'm scared to confront her on this. She dosen't take bad news like this too well. A part of me is scared she'll yell at me for being lazy, which is irrational. But what I'm more worried about is that she will shove ""autistic accomodations"" down everyone's throats. She likes to believe that I'm autistic, when in reality I'm diagnosed with ADHD and depression. Because of this, I've gotten some accomodations but I never apply them. I worry about this because she's going to insist I stay on this track when I dont 100% know what I want for myself. I have a plan, but I could abandon it.

How do I tell her I don't want to stay in school?

TLDR - I want to drop out of college, and want to tell my mom who was the one that pushed college on me when I wasn't ready. How do I break the news?",relationships
"We've been together 8 months, living together for 4 months unofficially (I still have my place). I'd say 70% of the time I'm happy. I feel like we bicker way more than normal. He's usually kind, but then every few days he'll get a little passive aggressive or ""joke"" about my cooking, how much work I'm doing, how much coffee I've had to drink, whatever. And it'll usually turn into a few mean spirited jokes back and forth, one of us being hurt, and the other apologizing. Or I'll tell him I don't like that kind of humour and he'll apologize OR say he wasn't joking. I've told him again and again that I don't like the passive aggressive comments, but I think it's a big part of how he communicates with everyone. We usually move past it quickly and I've stopped joking back as it seems to escalate things. But the comments still pop up relatively frequently. 

But maybe I'm being too sensitive about this and every live together relationship has friction like this. It's the first time I've spent so much time with a partner. But it feels a tiny bit Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, though my partner is lovely most of the time, and it's not even argument level bickering, just a low level tension.

Is this normal? Maybe I'm just not cut out for ""banter"". Edit: I also feel like I'm becoming a more critical and passive aggressive partner myself, which I don't like. Edit 2: I also don't feel like it's flirty banter, as we have that sometimes, but this has a mean or ""real problem"" component to it. It's something he actually thinks down on me for (though when I mention it seems that way he apologises and says that's absolutely not the case, he thinks the world of me, and is so happy to have me in his life etc.).

"My sister [27F] and I [16M] have not told eachother we loved eachother since she got married 7 years ago. It’s almost become an unspoken rule. We are close, friendly, and would do anything for eachother but we never say those 3 words. 

I was young at the time and for some reason it felt weird to tell her I loved her, starting the day she was married. 

Now, it’s been 7 years and I feel like it would be really awkward to say to her, even when I want to. We know we love eachother, but we just don’t say it. 

I don’t want to go on for the rest of my life without saying it to her, but it’s also super awkward to say it. 

I’m also worried that if something happened to one of us, we would regret never saying it to eachother... I just don’t know how to approach this or if I should even say it.

We are friendly and there is no tension in between us, so I’m not worried about that, it just feels weird to do something I haven’t done since I was young. 

TL;DR My sister and I haven’t told eachother that we love eachother since she was married 7 years ago, and I don’t know if I should approach this issue, and if I do, I don’t know how.",relationships
"So when I first started dating her I hung out with their family a lot, in November we decided to live together. It was then she told me the stuff shes been facing at her house.

Her sisters boyfriend is a drunk creep and has many times touched her inappropriately, and after telling her mom about it her mom brushed it under the rug and wouldn't believe her. He has also done inappropriate shit to her mom as well and I guess her sister and the creepy boyfriend fight about it sometimes. In December, after we moved she called me saying he went into her room and was stroking her leg near her crotch 

Fast forward to today and she tells me that she would really appreciate it if i went with her to spend the night over there and that she wants her family to love me. To my understanding I didn't think her family hated me. However after asking her about what she meant she said her family have been saying things about me. One of which is that I was controlling her, and that she seems to be working a lot.

The second point i can agree on, I have been unemployed and have been unable to find a job for a few months, and the pandemic certainly isn't helping with that, plus the fact that I have to find a place that is willing to work with my school schedule.

However I take great offense the me controlling her. I never told her in this entire relationship that she can't do something. I understand those are her parents and I make my opinions known and tell her that the way her family is is the reason I do not go over there anymore, But she can go if she wants to. In fact her mom was the one using guilt to get her to come over. I told her that I don't appreciate her family talking about me like that behind my back

I just feel like her mom/family is trying to make this relationship fail by manipulating her. I had a very rocky and traumatic childhood at the hands of my family and it just feels like I'm going through it again and that she is going through it as well. I'm able to realize that family can be toxic but she seems to not have come to the realization i have had.

She was extremely upset that I didn't go with her today and I can already feel a divide happening. I'm just asking what I should do and for general advice

TL;DR : my girlfriend is upset that I wont see her family. I state my reasons that they have said things about me to her behind my back, her mom covering for her sisters rapist boyfriend, and her mom manipulative attitude",relationships
"I (22M), am planning on breaking up with my girlfriend (24F) tomorrow. I am a nervous, anxious wreck and don't know exactly how to put into words what I need to tell her. I have been needing to do this for a while (made a post a couple months ago asking for advice...), But I am finally kicking myself in the ass hard enough to do it. I know that now is a good time, at least as good as it's going to get; There is nothing going on/no excuses as to why I shouldn't, waiting longer will just make it more likely that it won't be a ""good"" time. Pushing it back will only make it a bigger problem for my future self. I've come to realize and accept this fact. I know what needs to be done. I just don't know exactly what I'm supposed to say to her and how to answer her questions. We've been together for 3 years, this is a big, life-altering decision, and boy does it suck mightily. 

My main reason for breaking up boils down to my ""gut feelings"" of not seeing her in my future and not having plans to propose/get married. Like I said, we've been together for 3 years. She 100% wants to get married and has for a long time. In the past, I viewed her as the unreasonable one: We hadn't been together long enough and I had a lot on my plate with work, school, etc. Those reasons aren't really valid anymore; We've been together for more than enough time to get engaged and doing so should be independent of the other things going on in my life. The thing is, I just don't see it happening or even think about it. I do not think about proposing to her or marrying her when I think about my future and my plans. Not only is it not a ""for sure"" thing, I don't even consider it or give it any possibility at all. It's a harsh, ugly truth. 

I used to tell myself that I needed more time and may naturally grow to want the same things that she does. I didn't want to just end things simply because I didn't feel the same way that she did at the time. But, that hasn't changed. In no natural/organic way have I made plans to propose or see a future married together. In my head, that was just a vague, far-off time. Well, that time has caught up with me; We've been together a while now, and she is more than justified in desiring the things she does. I do not want to be together, and she deserves to know the truth. My feelings obviously haven't changed and she doesn't deserve to have any more of her time wasted, and I don't need to waste anybmore of my time either. 

So, a few days ago, I was over at her house to have dinner with her family and celebrate her mom's birthday. While we were in her room, she asked point blank what my plans were for us. I blurted out a big "" I don't know"" and told her I needed some time to put my thoughts together. She rightfully became upset and started crying, but I told her I did not want to do *this* now and said I would leave if she couldn't agree to talk Tuesday (the next time we both had a day off). She asked a couple of times if I wanted to break up and I told her no. We both worked the next several days and that is NOT the reason I came over. It may be arguable as to whether I should have just done it then and there, but I did not feel it was a good time and was caught off-guard. 

But, yeah, this is obviously a huge weight on me right now. Terrible sinking feeling in my stomach, a lot of anxiety. I know I'll be ready to have a heart attack all day tomorrow until I see her, but I know it needs to be done. I just know it's going to be really rough on her. She is very emotional dependent and this will be her worst nightmare, at least in the short term. There is nothing I dread more than having to tell her this, and I know that there's nothing she dreads more than hearing this news. Any advice on how to make myself do this without having a mental breakdown beforehand? And how exactly I should tell her this?

TL;DR: Have ""committed"" to breaking up with my girlfriend tomorrow, clearly a difficult situation, what/how do I tell her?",relationships
"Back in November, I matched with a guy on Tinder thinking nothing of it in the beginning. He was the only guy I ever went really far with before shortly deleting the app. We never officially entered in a relationship but there was a connection that I can’t really explain (or so I thought) and being the type of person I am, I inevitably caught feelings for him as we started seeing each other more and more. 

He was always inconsistent in replying to my texts as time went on, but I always gave him the benefit of the doubt. However, it got to the point where he wouldn’t respond to me for days and that always got under my skin. I didn’t want to pry and like I mentioned earlier, always gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

I think the biggest thing that happened was when one night, while in the middle of sex, he stopped me and I knew something wasn’t right. I asked him if everything was okay only to be told that he was still in love with another girl he hadn’t talked to in months....ouch. I was a bit heartbroken and thought, “Great. I’m nothing more than a rebound to fill the void his ex left him.” It’s an awful feeling and I wish I dropped him that night, but I’m young and naive and always want to see the best in people no matter what my intuition tells me. And so, I stayed despite missing an obvious red flag. 

We would still hang out the following month and talked on a regular basis despite the inconsistencies. The last time we actually saw each other was in the end of 2019. However, we still talked to each other afterwards. He was going through a lot of personal issues in the beginning of the year and being that I cared a lot about him, I stayed. I figured it was the only right thing to do. 

As the year went on, he started talking to me less and less and I started getting the feeling that I was being ghosted. It got to the point where I just couldn’t make excuses for him anymore. I thought, “Well maybe he just isn’t that into me.” As much as I cared about him, I felt like he only wanted to talk to me when he wanted me to come over. I began to reciprocate the same energy and ultimately began the process of moving on without making a fuss. 

One evening, I was stuck after school for a long band rehearsal. I get a snap of him telling me “Hey :)” at the end of a 15 minute break. I was in the middle of responding to him only to be told to put my phone up since rehearsal was starting again. I had every intention of getting back to him after rehearsal but I simply forgot. I got home, took a nap and woke up to another snap from him saying, “Uh okay”. I apologized to him and explained what happened but he left me on opened. I thought, “Well, I guess this is where it ends.” And I left it at that. 

Four days later, he sends me a snap at 4am telling me to “just fuck off” and I didn’t know what to say. Not to mention, it was on Valentines Day, too. Anyways, I just told him that I was sorry for whatever I did to make him upset and he didn’t respond for a couple more days. Later that weekend, he finally responds, profusely apologizing and telling me that he shouldn’t have taken his issues out on me. As empathetic as I may be, I really wasn’t having it and told him that it was best if we stopped talking for a while until he’s in a better place to do so. I told him I didn’t really believe in blocking unless it was absolutely necessary. He surprisingly took it very well and we left it at that. 

Fast forward a month and a half later. He posts something on Instagram, and I have a habit of liking every picture on my feed so I liked it thinking nothing of it. I wish I didn’t because five minutes later, I get a snap from him. He even tried to call me. I didn’t answer his call but I did respond to his message. Long story short, he tells me that he’s still very sorry with what happened and that he still cares about me and hasn’t stopped thinking about me, etc etc. He even brought up the idea of a relationship. We intended on seeing each other again but with the quarantine and lockdown, it was difficult to do so. We began talking again but I guess old habits never go away because he began leaving me on delivered for long periods of time again. We even went two weeks without talking after he decided he wanted to be in my life again. Of course, I was naive enough to let him back in. 

Last week, he congratulated me on getting into college which was really sweet of him despite being left on opened for two weeks. We start talking again once more, and to no surprise, he leaves me on delivered again. He would still watch my stories so I knew he was just blatantly ignoring me. 

Five days pass and he consumed my thoughts. I began overthinking until I just couldn’t take it anymore. I decide that it was time to block him once and for all. The sad part was that I couldn’t even bring myself to do it so I gave my best friend the logins to my social media and told her to block him for me. I know it sounds dumb but I figured I needed the extra help. 

I can’t help but think that I could have done more to have kept him engaged. Maybe I shouldn’t have blocked him. Maybe I should have put my pride aside and double texted him. Perhaps I did do the right thing but it sure doesn’t feel like it. I blocked him with no explanation and I can’t help but feel shitty about it. If I go back now, I’ll look stupid. I still care about him but I can’t help but think that I didn’t care about him enough and there was something more I could have done to show it. 

Was it immature of me to block him out of the blue? 



TL;DR: I caught feelings for a guy who I have a feeling is still in love with his ex. He takes forever to respond to my texts unless he wants me to come over, and I wasn’t having it anymore so I started reciprocating that same energy. I leave his text on opened one night, he gets upset and tells me to fuck off. He apologizes, but I tell him to not talk to me until he’s in a better place to do so and he respects it. A month later, he texts me trying to rekindle our relationship and I naively give in. His behavior remains unchanged and I finally decide to block him for good without explanation.",relationships

My  friend told me today that he doesn't want to seeing me anymore and  thinks less of me because I use weed and alcohol. I than said that I  don't have to use any substances around him. But then he still said that  he thinks less of me and said i am really stupid to use them.

 I don't see why I'm in uni just like he is and even getting better grades than him. I still want to be his friend and wish that he wouldn't think of my  that way. But I don't want to stop using weed and alcohol because they  are fun and don't hinder my life in anyway. What should I do ?

So I used to be like really close nit friends with this girl from school. Known her throughout pretty much my whole childhood. I want to make it clear that there was genuinely 0 sexual or romantic connection between us. We both knew exactly how we felt and we knew we were only close friends. We had one of the best friendships and we were together a lot of the time. Towards the end of my school year I met my girlfriend and as my ex best friend was moving to a different school our friendship kind of drifted apart. We didn’t speak for ages, and it wasn’t just for the reason that I was know with someone we just barley talked because the distance away from eachother and always saw eachother at school. My girlfriend was well aware of our friendship, and she too has a close friend who is of opposite sex which I don’t have a single thing against and I know he’s a trustworthy guy and she is incredibly loyal and isn’t someone who would do that. However the feelings are kind of different on her end. I know she’s a jealous person so I know she wasn’t exactly going to be overjoyed with my ex best friend being a girl. When we met at a party with my girlfriend there, I was very excited to see her as was she to me, I gave her a hug and we didn’t speak loads but I suppose it was just one of those awkward haven’t seen you in ages types of things. As time went on my ex best friend and my girlfriend built a bit of a dislike for eachother. I personally don’t know the cause but I suppose I can draw some conclusions. My girlfriend who I can barley ever see negatives in and I love so much is openly jealous about my ex best friend, and my ex best friend sees my girlfriend as a bit of a barrier to re couping our friendship. We don’t ever talk consistently me and my ex best friend, but to get to the point she occasionally will send me snapchat memories and ask me if I remember something funny and I can’t help but feel guilty as fuck. I don’t know why but whenever I see a message from her I go sick to my stomach. My girlfriend hasn’t always had the greatest reception to her messaging me and she often gets really upset. I don’t really know what to do. Should I feel guilty? Or worried about her messages. I’m worried for how my girlfriend is going to feel. I could really use some help.

My girlfriend and ex best friend slowly built a dislike for eachother and now I feel sick to my stomach every time I come into contact or receive messages from my ex best friend. Should I feel this way, I don’t really know how to approach this.",relationships
"*TL;dr at the end.*

We have been friends for several months now. He’s (“Adam”) honestly like my best friend now, because the bonding we’ve experienced since meeting is something I’ve never experienced with anyone else. I can tell him everything with ease and comfort...except this.

Guilt has been gnawing at me for the past couple of weeks, and I couldn’t put my finger on it until last night. We haven’t been talking even half as much as we used to, and this past week I’ve been frustrated with him because it doesn’t seem like he likes my group of friends (my main hobby and line of work is male dominant). Every time I so much as mention that I want to join my friends, even with him, he noticeably shuts down and then seems upset for the rest of the night. It’s coming off as insecurity, but I’m not sure.

The guilt comes in because I finally admit that I enjoy attention from men. I think I’ve been in denial of this since I first started to “flower” over a decade ago. I strongly believe in loyalty and honesty, so I could never cheat. Although I never try to gain attention from men, and I especially don’t entertain them if they try to flirt with me, I get a weird satisfaction when they talk to me or make jokes. I don’t even giggle, flip my hair, or anything of the sort; I’m actually known to be reserved and sometimes standoffish.

Despite this, I still find that I actually like the attention. This upsets me because I’ve found something special with Adam, but now I see that since we aren’t talking as much, I’m enjoying the attention from men much more. I also discovered something about Adam that does not sit well with me. It was cute at first, when he did it once in a while, but I notice this is a problem he has when he gets clingy or needy, and it’s showing so much more now that it’s coming off as pathetic. I’ve told him this (in a more polite way), and I repeatedly told him to stop because it seemed like he was pouting(?!), and I think it somewhat offended him.

He still does it, and I have to catch myself from grimacing or rolling my eyes. 

This is troublesome, because I’m sure Adam is going to ask to make us an official couple soon, yet this guilt makes me not want to accept, and now I feel like I’ve led him on. That is definitely NOT the case, because his other qualities and spending quality time with him still make me feel like I’ve wandered into a dream.

I just don’t understand why I enjoy male attention so much, and I wish I didn’t. It makes me feel pathetic and undeserving of love, especially from Adam.

I’m not sure if I should tell him this, nor do I know what or how to say this if I should. I’m truly lost.

**TL;DR** \- I usually enjoy attention from men, but I’m currently seeing someone (“Adam”) who wants to make us official. I didn’t think twice about men when Adam and I started to bond, but now that we’re not talking as much as we used to, and he has a particular quality (i.e., clingy...?) that I don’t like, I’m enjoying the attention from men much more, and I feel incredibly guilty.",relationships

Throwaway and I don't wanna be too specific as I don't wanna be identified

So some context first: before we started dating we were friends, like best friends. She was seeing someone else and I admitted my feelings, they weren't reciprocated initially and a few months later we got together after a rough patch in our friendship.

First 2 months or so were great and we were both really happy. Coronavirus quarantine started a few months ago where I live, and we were unable to see each other. Despite that, we initially held together well, obviously longing to see each other but still good nonetheless.

For the last week or two however, she's been extremely distant and dismissive, and when we talked about it she admitted that in relationships she always reached a point where she idolized people followed up by distancing herself. She said she worried she might have BPD, and considering both of our pasts, along with the way that she can react to fairly minor setbacks, I see this as a very high possibility (Despite the lack of an official diagnosis).

We talked recently about our situation, and what we should do to move forward. She hasn't been socializing nor doing exercise nor going outside at all (not from fear of the virus, but rather because she doesn't want to, she told me specifically) despite it being allowed now, which I think is partly to blame for our relationship issues, especially due to her seeming depressed/disassociated lately. I firmly she wants to break up, but doesn't want to ""lose me"" with our history so she isn't willing to admit it to me. I like her a lot, and I would like to go back to how things were before, however it bothers me how I can't seem to get through to her how her mental state can improve if she just puts a little effort into it.

We talked to each other about this, full honesty (coming at least from me) and she admitted yes she didn't wanna lose me, but she denied actually wanting to break up which I think was a lie. At one point in the conversation I think she tried to make it seem like we were basically friends the last few weeks anyways, and that we could end things since they're not working, implying things wouldn't change between us.

She said she would put more effort into herself in terms of rebuilding healthy habits, but I fear that she said this for the sake of preservation rather than from an actual desire. I think that the pure isolation is seriously hurting her, and if she focused on putting the effort to meet up with people and call them and do anything other than watch YouTube all day she could be better for herself which would be better for the issues between us.

In my heart of hearts, I think this relationship in its current state is really unhealthy. I like this girl a lot but if I really want what's best for myself I should end things and move on. However, considering the quarantine situation, it's not unreasonable to assume that a big part of the issues is coming from that, and that time and some effort from both of us would help. Beyond that, I don't think it's the best idea to end things not only from the potential of things to improve, but because of university coming up, these are the last few months we have together before moving on to different lives in different countries.

I feel unsure of what the right move is, and I fear that things won't get better. I do have hope that this turmoil is just a phase caused by BPD and that we will move past it, but I also feel like it is unfair to her to prolong this when I don't think she wants to keep saying in the end.



I apologise if this story seems all over the place, but I would really appreciate some advice and maybe some help in this issue.

What should I do? Should I hope things get better, or should I give up? Is it worth it to deal with someone that has BPD, despite the issues it may bring?

Thank you


**TL;DR:** My ex-best-friend girlfriend Might have BPD. Things were good, quarantine happened, things stopped being good. She's been fully home isolated with no socialization nor exercise nor going outside at all, which I think is a huge contributing factor to our issues. I think she wants to break up but doesn't admit it because she doesn't want to lose me as a whole. I want her to put effort into those things, which she said she would do but I kind of doubt her honesty in that. I need advice, I wanna stay with her but I'm not sure if it's healthy and I don't know if things will improve.",relationships
"My mother told me a few years back that my father cheated on her. They are still married and things go on as if nothing happened.

"Hello everyone, so the issue is this...

I (18M) broke with my ex (20F) a couple of months ago. I'm still in love with my her but feel terrible about the situation. I don't really know what to do. I don't know if I should talk to her or should I keep some distance. One issue is that we will have to see each other nevertheless because we have the same group of friends and the same major. We are ""friends"" and our relationship is fairly good compared of what it had to been through. I don't know any much of what's her life now, if she has a new partner or what's going on with her friends, her family, etc. I would like to think she just moved on and has a new partner tbh, just to cope with all of this I think. I also dated people but nothing serious happened, just made some new friends. 
The problem is that we still chat quite a bit, I regularly send her memes and other stuff which she replies and sometimes does the same. She confessed she felt bad about not doing the same and she liked that I did that as a response after I asked her if I was bothering her with what I was doing. But I feel bad, I didn't feel so good the day after that. I still love her and want to be with her, but I have this feeling I have to leave the idea of having something for her but I just love her. I don't know what to do. Telling her that would be a bomb due to what it implies and the current Corona situation. (In our country we have sort of a national lockdown) 
What should I do? 

TLDR: I still have feeling for my ex. That makes me feel terrible and don't know what to do. We are ""friends"". Don't know anything about her personal life after the broke up tbh. I think she has a new partner just like a way to cope with it. The lockdown isn't helping too much.

"Ok so basically the title says it all. For a little background, boyfriend and his girl bff been friends for the longest time, we all knew each other in high school and we’re all almost finished with college now, and my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years.

So I’m already pretty uncomfortable, but she’s always been sweet to me and the past is the past so I can’t really do anything about it. 

Anyway, the one thing that got me was that boyfriend and I were at the beach with a bunch of friends today, girl BFF was there too. I was sitting directly next to boyfriend and I guess while I was not paying attention, girl bff takes a picture of him, captions it something sappy about him being such a great friend and wouldn’t know what to do without him and all that which is *totally fine* but literally cropped me out of the picture and went out of her way to make sure I wasn’t in it when all I was doing was sitting down. Like it’s so obvious she cropped me out of the picture. And this was for Snapchat so like .... ?? What was the point? Wtf. It made me extremely uncomfortable that she would go to lengths like that to crop me out because people even came up and asked me about it. If she wanted a picture that bad she should have just asked him to get up and take a cute pic with him or something instead of doing what she did... It just rubs me the wrong way knowing their history and that she made it so obvious she cropped someone out of the picture, because everyone knew it was me and I had people ask me about it. Am I wrong for being bothered? I need advice :(

Hey guys,

A few days ago my relationship came to an end. We've known each other for a while and finally got together about a year ago. She was my first girlfriend and I was living with her at her parents house full time after only a month of being together. I don't really remember how that was decided, it just kinda happened. She has a few mental issues, such as bipolar I, depression, dyslexia, OCD. She's also quite partial to alcohol. I'm not without my faults, I have depression. We get along really well and she's actually super smart. However, last november, after some drinking she got really sad and I had to hold her down to prevent her from killing herself. That kinda damaged me mentally. Another issue we've had is that she is the really jealous type. She didn't like to admit it at first but she doesn't like when I spend time with my friends, and it slowly became more apparent. In the winter, I wasn't feeling too hot for a few days and I ended up breaking up with her. It was a messy breakup and she tried everything in the book from guilt, anger, persuasion, holding me down, and grabbing my expensive laptop in a threatening way. After several hours I left and she blew my phone up and I was honestly kinda scared she'd hurt herself. My friends and family were all not very big fans of her. However, the breakup destroyed me and we eventually got back together after a very rough couple of weeks. However, she made it really clear that she wanted marriage, kids, and to move out ASAP, which I'm not ready for. She broke up with me and immediately got back together with me several times for variations of this. Also, she's very opinionated with how often I shave, get hair cuts, dress, etc. The other day, she was going to get me some gel nail things to prevent me from biting my nails. I didn't really want them and she got mad and stormed out. That turned into a fight about me not listening to her about my nails, hair, etc. Somehow that transitioned into her saying she wants to move away next year and if i loved her I should drop school and follow her. I said maybe I could get into school where she's moving but I need more time. She got upset and said she sacrificed all her dreams to be with me and I should be doing the same. She eventually broke up with me and then immediately promised to make things work. The next day, I was really upset and mentioned the possibility of taking a break so we can both figure stuff out. That somehow turned into her saying I'm on a path to failure since I still live at home, have the same job as I did in high school (manager in retail), and have the same friends that I did in high school. I think my job is awesome for the time being and I love all my friends (most of which i've known for over half my life) . It ended up in a situation where I had to either quit my job and leave all my friends to be able to stay with her. I refused and walked out. Ever since then, she's been blowing up my phone and i've been ignoring every communication from her. I miss her a lot and worry about her, but I think she's being a little unfair. Maybe I'm wrong. Also, please understand this is all negatives and there were many good things about our relationship too. Also, i've messed up a few times as well but I feel every mistake I made was fairly minor and the only notable wrong I did was sending kind of a mean message post breakup in the winter. I'm not perfect and neither is she, I'm just curious what people think. I'll update if I think of anymore details.

"My boyfriend of 2 years told me last night that he worries that when I tell him that I love his body or that I love a particular item of clothing on him, he thinks I’m fetishizing him because of how western white women fetishize black men. I said that I love how a particular shirt looks against his skins tone, and that was the trigger. I also say that to my mom or my co-workers when I think the same thing, which he said was weird (I think complimenting people on a well chosen outfit is a nice thing to do). But he believes I’m pointing out his otherness by mentioning the color of his skin. I reminded him that physical attraction is a big part of a healthy relationship and it’s only a part of my attraction to him overall. Yes, I think my boyfriend is damn sexy. And also brilliant and funny and ... I only wish he complimented me and my body the way I do him and his. I think he’s sexy AF. Don’t we all want our partners to be crazy attracted to us? Isn’t that normal?

"TLDR: my lying cheating ex has been self isolating. What can I do to help myself deal with her returning (and presumably causing more problems for me) after the lockdown ends

My ex and I broke up in February. In March she started self isolating because her step dad is at risk. So I haven’t seen her since the start of March, thankfully. After she started self isolating I found out that she cheated on me with not one of my friends but two. She lied to me about it for months. She dumped me to get with the second friend. She’s been spreading lies about me to my friends and basically ruining my life. There is a lot, lot, lot more to the story but that’s the basics of it. 

I’m worried about when my ex comes back to work. When the lockdown lifts and she can stop self isolating. I’m not sure that I can be mature let alone professional around her anymore and I don’t want to risk my job because I can’t control my emotions about the disgusting things she’s done to me this year. 

I’ve already informed my manager about the situation and what my ex did, I’ve told my manager that I’ve been considering getting a different job to avoid my ex but that hasn’t worked out very well. My manager told me that it’s completely fine. That my manager is going to be giving my ex alternating shifts to me so we don’t have to see each other or interact. My manager also said not to risk my financial stability just because of what my lying cheating ex has done and told me that she’d only feel comfortable with me quitting if I have at least an interview lined up for a new job. 

I’ve also told a few of my work friends about what my ex has done but people overheard me talking about it and now almost the entire shop knows that my ex cheated on me. I think that a lot of the staff are on “my side” of all this because of people talking about what they’ve overheard. Which I guess is a bonus but it might make things a big mess when my ex gets back and starts spreading her lies around the shop like she’s done with some of my friends.",relationships

TL;DR - I’m 14. Some guy stole pictures of me off Instagram. My profile was public but I just set it to private. This guy photoshopped himself into my pictures. It actually looks like we took the picture together. He used some filter over it. I don’t know this guy, personally. He did go to my school, was in the grade above me and never talked to me, I just saw him in the hallways, never had any classes or anything with him. He moved out of state two years ago. I never talked to him or friended him anywhere. I don’t know why he did this. There is also a fake account with my pictures that goes by a fake name that also DM’s him. He posted some birthday shoutout for me using the photoshopped pics (it’s not my birthday, my bday is in November) and said I can’t believe we’ve been in a relationship for almost a year. I found The picture Today under the quarantinelife hashtag and it has almost 400 likes. I asked people from my school if they know about it and none of them knew he was doing this. None of my friends remember his name either (it’s not on the Instagram account) they recognize the face though. They think he’s buying likes. How do I get this to stop?",relationships
"Hi I’m a boy, about 14 and is doing greatly today.
My mother is in her 50s, and has always been very lovely to me.

This is my first post so some of the information might not be very clear.

Issue:
I’ve recently figured out that she’s been posting pictures of me that I clearly told her to not post.
And yet, she seems to continue this on until today I finally managed to confront her about a video she recorded which I told her in the video to not post on social media.

I know that she took the pictures herself, and wanted to post it. I accept the younger photos of me as she tries to relive her memories, but the pictures and videos I really don’t want her to post, she just ends up posting it up on the internet.

I love her dearly, but I just want to tell her that she needs to respect my privacy a bit more, and should ask me before posting a photo or a video about me onto the internet.

tl:dr - Mother posts picture about me on social media I really don’t want her to post.

What do you think I should do?",relationships
" 

Hi everyone. Thank ya'll in advance. I've been in this relationship for 3 years, we moved together last year but she moved out in February. She's been cold and distant, this happened a year ago as well, where for a while she was acting as if she was either cheating or not interested in me any more. Any attempt to communicate with her about that resulted in her going off on me. It got the the point where I asked her if she needed a break and she very excitedly agreed. After a while she ghosted me and only popped up to tell me that she was falling for someone and that had been going on for a few months during our relationship. I let her be and wished her well and after a while she came back.

Or relationship was much better the second time around. We would argue from time to time, but over all it was a great partnership. Sort of. About a year ago I noticed that I was the only one putting in effort and asked her why that was she said ""I dont need to, I know I already have you""

Since the break up, she went cold and distant. I gave her space. She would say shes not sure if we're together or if she wants to be together. Ive heard from friends that shes saying she's single. She says she's not saying that, but her friends and family are and she's not correcting them. She's pretty much only reached out for when she needs things. She doesn't call or text and says she's too busy.

About 2 weeks ago she started coming around being sweet... But had me help her with her car. She was sweet all week, we spent time together, were intimate, etc. She was sweet up until she picked up her car. The following day she was back to cold and distant.

She's only reached out since then because this thirsty prison inmate(who went to jail for stabbing his last ex) is getting out soon and he found out that I had been dating one of his previous exs. We used to work with this guy and he would bully my girlfriend everyday, and every day she'd cry. He had a girlfriend at the time that he cheated on with my girl's cousin. and then was arrested for stabbing an ex. He's been in jail 3 years, and gets out in a couple of months. Now all of a sudden he wants to reach out to my girl so that she can write to him because he's lonely. Even though, he talks with his ex wife, my girl's cousin and others on the regular. My girl didn't remember that he used to bully her, at all. She doesn't believe that ever happened. I asked her if she was going to write to him, she said no, but that didn't turn out to be true.

So now that he's been telling her that I was dating or seeing someone, now she's saying we are together and if i did that, that would be wrong. In the last 2 weeks she's literally have only contacted me about her car and this dude.

Those last 2 weeks she was soo sweet, so affectionate, saying she misses and loves me. But that seems to have entirely stopped.

I know this is a lot. And theres a lot more and I'd be happy to elaborate or share more. This has been really difficult for me. Mentally and emotionally. I'm not eating or sleeping much. I just want to be ok.

A part of me tells me she's playing me but another part of me says that I love her and should keep trying. Any and all advice would be VERY greatly appreciated. Thank ya'll  


  
TL;DR: Girlfriend of 3 years is being cold and distant and unclear weather we are together or if she even wants to be. Will randomly be sweet and caring and reach out. How can I know if i'm being played?",relationships
"My boyfriend and i have been on and off during the past 2 years constantly trying to figure out how to support each other in the ways we need it. His mom is dying of cancer and they don't have a great relationship at all, most times with her being really nasty and unsupportive towards him. He talks about just not wanting to exist sometimes/dying and when he comes to me for support, I always tell him how much I love him and support him, and how important he is etc, but most times I just cant figure out what to do. During the corona virus, I was always more cautious than him about social distancing, mask etc. and my mom and i tested positive because she worked in a hospital. He asked me to stay with him for 2 weeks, and i told him i didnt want to get him or his mom sick.On top of that, i still live with my mom and have had a pretty strict Caribbean upbringing where its hard for me to just get up and spend 2 weeks out of the house especially during this time (and my mother doesn't know about him)...He broke up with me for that and my lack of support, and didn't speak to me for two weeks. And then when he reached out he's always talking about how he doesn't want to live because of having to deal with his moms suffering, and that I have no idea how much it could have helped with me being there physically. Its just so much because he talks so much about ending it and how me being there physically would help but this is not an everyday stay over with us. My mom and I just tested negative days ago, but we still don't know if i could possibly get him sick bc my breathing isnt all the way 100%. I also don't want to make up some extreme lie in going over to his house and having my mother see me as selfish for wanting to stay at a friends house for 2 weeks during quarantine, especially since she's been a bit obsessed about it, having pneumonia with the virus as well. And when i try to explain to him my positions, he just says ""forget it"" or ""don't worry about it"".

Edit: I've also been really irritated at something he said last night when i felt like i had no choice in certain matters about staying with him AFTER I was exposed to the virus with my mom. He said ""what if i had left a note exclaiming to you how much i just needed you there or how much it would have helped to have you stay over""... I don't want to be mean but wtf. Like if you killed yourself, and then wrote a note, is that supposed to put the blame on me to say I wouldn't stay with you after being exposed to the virus. His emotions with his mom &amp; all of this, clouds everything I tell him and i don't know if im being selfish. Not to mention how for the past 2 years Ive literally spent so much time trying every way I could to support him, bend every barrier at home, and give him what he needs, besides finally bringing up therapy when he wasn't so defensive about it.

am i overreacting? am i just being dumb and i should support my bf? And just say fuck it. idk bc i ""was"" positive. but i really feel like im in a corner between **the virus, my mother and my boyfriend..help**

TLDR: Bf wants me to come stay with him to help deal with mom dying. My mom and I had corona, recently tested neg, and I feel guilty for poss. risking health and lying to mom about why id want to leave the house (which would never go over her that well). He sees it all as an excuse and says ive always struggled to be there for him

Edit: so he cursed me out again, telling me how much he blames for his addictions, suicidal thoughts and leaving a girl that would've helped him better according to him. Is this all my fault?  I can literally feel myself for the millionth time. All over again. ",relationships
"Using my old mua account to post. 

For some clarity, I am currently not officially seeing any clients, my 'side hobby' is at a standstill for the foreseeable future. Also, I have never had sex with anyone while acting as a dominatrix. I know people do it, but it's not for me.

To keep the backstory short, I have always had a sexually sadistic side in me. I'm not a psychopath who gets off on hurting or upsetting people, I only enjoy sadism when it's part of a consensual understanding between adult parties. Ever since I was a teenager, I thought I was very weird for fantasising about hurting men I was attracted to, until I found out about the D/s world at around age 15 and realised there were 'others' like me.

It has created some real obstacles for me in the past. There have been many boyfriends who I have hidden this from, knowing it would freak them out. Since turning 18, I put myself out there more as a Domme, had clients, and really found myself sexually. It was a nice earner while I was studying too. I have never had romantic feelings for any sub so far.

Anyway, for about a year I've been cooling off the scene. All my friends are getting married/having kids and I want that in my future too. It would be great to find a man who reciprocates my preferences, but I understand that it's a lot to ask.

I've started dating a really great guy. Since the quarantine began, I've been amazed by how well we're getting along, even if we can no longer see each other. For the first time in a long time, I actually have relationship-y feelings for someone. We both have really intense corporate jobs that meant that before lockdown, we didn't see a lot of each other and so we're still in the 'getting to know each other' phase. As a result, we haven't had sex yet in the six months or so we've been dating. This is fine with me, I think it's been useful in building a connection that's not just about sex.

As I said, I previously hid my preferences from my past boyfriends, worried it would scare them. Now I feel that if I was in a proper relationship with someone, I think they would deserve to know about that part of my life. It might be seen as a 'lie by omission' if I never said anything about it. Still, is it relevant as 'sexual history' if I never had sex with any of my clients?

How do I and at what point do I tell my new bf about my past, or should I even mention it? I would be really embarrassed if he thought my intention at telling him was because I wanted him to 'sub' for me - that's really not it. I don't mind burying this part of me if the person I'm with isn't interested, but I think that they should know all the same.

Please let me know your thoughts, I will probably delete this soon.

"Til;dr: my boyfriend is the best guy I know and I know in my heart he wouldn’t cheat on me but I’m paranoid about it anyways, help?

I (22f) have absolutely no evidence to support the thought that my bf (22m) would ever cheat on me, but for some reason it’s still a thought that’s hanging around in my brain??

He’s the sweetest and most emotionally open guy I’ve ever dated, his parents got divorced a few years back because his dad cheated on his mom with a family friend. He said that disgusted him and he doesn’t speak to his dad anymore for a number of reasons.

He’s always saying how I’m his whole world and he loves me so much and stuff like that, but during this time apart cause of Covid, I’ve been feeling extra bad about myself physically and mentally and my self esteem is at like zero. I compare myself to other girls all the time and always ask myself why he’s with me.

We’re apart right now obviously, and the thoughts in my mind are like what if he’s sexting other people? What if he’s messaging hot Instagram girls? What if he secretly has a crush on someone else? And other stuff like that. 

For my whole life I’ve been paranoid that whenever I’m out of peoples direct eye sight they’ll forget about me. My parents, friends, boyfriends. I have no reason to believe that he would ever cheat on me, we’ve actually talked about it before and he says he would never do that and be like his dad, and I do believe him. But I’m still worried I’m not good enough and that without this time together he’ll grow bored.

I’m scared of him cheating because this is the first real relationship I’ve had and he’s the first guy I’ve loved. I’m terrified that now that we’ve gotten so close and our lives are so interwoven that if that broke I would be a complete mess for who knows how long. 

Idk, I can’t be the only person who’s been paranoid like this?? Can someone tell me how they got over these feelings? Thanks in advance",relationships
"Hey all,


This is a bit jumbled and an ongoing situation as it is so I apologise if its a mess.


I've been with my boyfriend for over 2 years and recently he's mentioned to me wanting to move over to my area. We had found somewhere for him to rent but it had fallen though because of gaurantour issues. He had mentioned it to his mam and she reacted badly at first but then started to accept it I think.


He's been in quarentine with me and my gran for a month as both me and my gran are at risk. He's been a huge help and his mam knew he was staying here until he started work, which he will this week, and has agreed to it.


When he spoke to her today she said she'd given his room to her friend because he had not contacted her, he had been in contact to send over rent and ask how she is, and she's blocked him. So essentially he's now homeless as she said he can come get his stuff anytime. 


He's staying here at the moment and my dad said he could take him in for a little but I just need advice on how to help him in this situation as I doubt he's accepted that he hasn't got somewhere permanent to stay. We've looked at properties today and other options.


Sorry for the huge post, I'm insanely upset and angry at his mam for what she has done.

I may be a year older than him but I feel much more mature and actually in touch with reality. I'm starting to see men with stable jobs, and goals, and want that.

"Throwaway because my bf is on Reddit

My bf (21M) and I (20F) have been dating for about two and a half years, with a little on / off action (we broke up for a few months bc I was depressed and needed space). Through that time, we slowly became more intimate, but each step was hard for me to be comfortable with. For example, I cried the first time he saw me in just my bra, the first time we did oral, etc. This is because of the way I was raised. My family is super Christian, to the point where holding hands / kissing your significant other is forbidden until after marriage (let alone seeing each other naked / sex). The amount of guilt I felt as we became more intimate slowly subsided as I became more comfortable, which was helped by the fact that my bf has been infinitely understanding and supportive. 

We have reached the point where penetrative sex is the obvious next step. He has been wanting to do this for a LONG time, but I've always been scared to do so. My parents' religion has always placed a premium on virginity, and so I assumed that since I have been moving further away from my childhood beliefs as I grow older (and go to uni) that these feelings of guilt about no longer being a virgin would go away after a few months ... but they didn't. 

Every time my bf asks when we will / gets sad bc us not having sex makes him think that I don't find him attractive, I feel enormously guilty because I've basically run out of excuses to deny him, other than that for some reason, I have a huge mental hang-up about stuff going in there. I'm wondering if living together or getting engaged would help, since I've had abandonment issues in the past and doing that would imply a lasting commitment, but I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. I would love help figuring out why I have such hang-ups about penetrative sex so that I can work through those issues. 

TLDR; My bf (21M) of 2 and a half years and I (20F) haven't had penetrative sex yet and I am terrified by the idea of having sex and I'm not sure what's causing the hesitation on my end, and I want to figure it out because my bf gets hurt by my refusal of sex.",relationships

"I live in a converted house and there are 3 apartments. My grandparents (who own the house and who I pay rent to) live on the first floor, my neighbor lives on the second floor, and I live on the third floor. I share a hallway, a staircase, and a balcony with my neighbor. My grandparents have their own entrance, etc.

My neighbor is a single retiree and an incredibly sweet person. When I moved in she hand-drew me a card and bought me some balloons. She also does all the maintenance for our shared spaces while I'm at work. Like she paints the walls, deep cleans the rugs, etc. I've offered several times to take on some of the responsibility, but she says she enjoys it because it gives her something to do while she's home. We even have some interests in common.

However, she is one of the most intense people I've ever met. Every time I see her in the hallway, she rapid-fire monologues at me for 20+ minutes, or until I can find an excuse to leave. She doesn't let me get a full sentence out before she interrupts me and starts talking about herself again. I leave every conversation with her feeling completely exhausted and emotionally drained.

This week she invited me to have a bottle of wine with her once she's done setting up the balcony for summer. Of course I said yes, since I'm genuinely grateful for all the work she does. She then started profusely apologizing for not being able to afford to import a $100 bottle of wine from Italy, so I spent a while reassuring her that something from the liquor store down the street was totally fine.

I'm happy to hang out with her every once in a while, since she's a genuinely nice person and she's obviously very lonely. But I'm worried that once I open this can of worms, she's going to want to hang out *all the time.* Like the first time I met her, she was already talking about having weekly movie nights together. How should I handle this going forward?

"Hi Reddit,

I (19F) have been dealing with this predicament for a while now. My father (53M) has been married and divorced twice now, and had children from his first marriage- I don’t know exactly what happened with him and his 1st ex wife and I didn’t really feel inclined to ask. So I never knew much about his history, the children he had with his ex wife, etc.

All I do know is that my dad has two other sons with his ex wife, one who has now recently tried to contact me again for the second time- and once via my dads old email, which I: 

1. Do not know how he got this email?

And

2. long story as to why emails sent to my dads old email get forwarded to me. Please don’t ask lol

I got this email in my inbox from his son, I’ll call him T, basically asking to meet and that my dad owe’s him this conversation and that it would be a fresh start for them and etc. To meet for a meal and/or coffee.

He also had messaged my via Facebook asking to talk and that since we are siblings we should talk- I honestly feel really bad for ignoring him, but at the same time I really don’t feel ready to invest into a new relationship with a complete stranger..

I dealt with this similarly before with a step brother from my mom’s side- it didn’t go well and I don’t feel emotionally comfortable with potentially going through it again. 

Am I a bad person for not wanting to start a new familial relationship with my dad’s son? I have nothing against him, I just don’t feel ready for something like that. I’m only 19 almost 20 years old and I only just recently escaped a terrible upbringing from my mother’s part and I kind of just want a break from everything associated with family. I live by myself away from home and I kind of just want to keep my distance like that.

Of course I’m going to tell my dad about this email and forward it to him incase he wants to contact his son but I don’t want to seem like an asshole for not wanting to contact him myself. Would I be an asshole for this? I don’t think I owe anyone anything but I don’t want to hurt anyone as a result of it.

Both kiddos have online classes daily, chores and time for hobbies and each evening we ride bikes, walk dogs or go play tennis.   On Friday nights they go to their dad's house for a few hours for pizza and movies and Saturday night he comes here and we play board games.

Daughter has been dating ""Seth"" for 1.5 years and mid/end March he had had to move back home from the dorms at a nearby college due the Corona and he lives with his parents and 17 year old brother.  Since being home from collage, Seth has gotten a job working in the kitchen at a local restaurant that only does take out food and his younger (17 yo) brother works there also.  Seth's dad is a reporter/editor for a local newspaper and his mom still works in an office with others as they are considered essential.  Basically Seth's whole family is out about town while our family is sheltering in place.

 When the lock down started, I allowed Seth to come over for a picnic, bike rides, painting rocks outside as long as they maintained 6 feet apart.   Seth sulked throughout the visit and told daughter that I was treating him like a sick animal that I wouldn't let into the house.   Next visit - daughter allowed on the screened in porch and Seth in a lawn chair on the side walk 6 feet away.

Daughter and I fought about it constantly in early April and I never gave in.   Mid April I mentioned to my friend that I thought daughter was over the battle because she has stopped arguing with me about it.  Friend suggested that they were sneaking to see each other.  I asked daughter and she admitted that he had been in my house (when I was delivering food to a friend) on 3 different occasions.   I have never been so angry.  She and Seth are jeopardizing her brother's life!   Punishments were given and Seth is no longer allowed at all. 

Now here we are in May and I'm still planning on sheltering in place for the foreseeable future as my boss is 74 and vulnerable and he's sheltering and OK with my continuing to work from home.

Daughter basically angry and barely speaks to me because I won't let her go do what her friends are doing  (work, hang out with friends and boy friends) and I don't know what to do.  I'm pissed and very hurt that she's so selfish as to not put her little brother's health above her own happiness.  Now that it looks like this sheltering will go on for months and months I'm really struggling to find a solution because we can't continue to live in this hostility.   I'm just asking for any solutions, suggestions or advice.

"We've been apart for a year. Since then, I've made a lot positive life changes and so has she.  I used to be direction-less, arrogant, and not very dependable, spending most of my time trying to act like I was smart but rarely put in actual work. Since the breakup, I've realized being hard-working, empathetic, and dependable is so much more important than trying to be the smartest guy in the room. I've dated other girls since then, and every date convinced me more that the girl I'd been looking for had been in front of me the whole time and I wasn't mature enough to see it. I like the life I have now, but I'd like it better if we gave it another shot. Worst case scenario, we aren't compatible and it doesn't work out, and if that's the case, I'll move on. All I want is to feel like I gave it my all. When we first broke up we didn't even fight, we hated confrontation and never really had a proper conversation about why we split, just a mutual agreement that the fire wasn't there. I don't think anyone wants a significant other who won't fight for them. I think she's grown positively too, and I want the chance for her to know the man I've become.

Tl;dr broke up with my ex a year ago and regret it. I've changed for the better and think I've become the man she and I both wanted me to be. What can I say to get my foot in the door and open up a dialogue?",relationships
"I (F30) have been in a long distance relationship with my (M34) boyfriend for one and a half years. This may be a little long, but I'd like to put a bit of context before starting with the main issue. 

I find myself a person who easily trusts in everyone. I've never had any problems giving my full trust to my family, friends and boyfriends in the past. Me myself don't really like to lie. I tend to avoid even white lies and try to be very upfront with everyone I meet.

I met my current boyfriend through online gaming. I've never had any bad experiences with this kind of things as I've made lots of long lasting friendships this way before, and a I meet a previous boyfriend this way too. 

The firsts months with him were really nice. He is a really sweet and caring man. The difference is that he is from a different country, a different continent. I've never dealed with a long distance relationship before and at first I wasn't sure I could handle it because I really enjoy physical contact, still and to my surprise, I've been really happy despite the distance.

However, from the start I've noticed he lies to me with really silly stuff and I always caught him because he is REALLY bad at doing it. He first lied about his age. When we met, I was 29 years and he told me he was 28, but then he told a friend of mine his real age (33 at the time). Really silly tbh. Later I noticed that when we were in voice chat, he suddenly would mute his microphone for like 3-5 seconds even while he was talking. When I asked why he did this, he'd say it was because his dogs were being loud and didn't want to bother me with the noise (never heard any barking). 

He told me he lived alone in a house with his 3 dogs. He'd send me some photos of his dogs and stuff, but from some reason, the sudden muting made me think it wasn't that way. 3 months later, and after me pressuring him a little bit he told me he was fired sometime ago after 10 years in the same place and had to move back with his parents, that he feels lost and depressed because he doesn't feel like a grown up man. After he moved with his parents, he never muted his mic again and I could hear when his parents or brother went into his bedroom to talk to him. My theory is that he always lived with his parents, but was too ashamed to tell me. Some time later I came to know that actually he wasn't fired, he quit  his job after some issues he had with his boss. He says he has a work right know. That he works for his father, but he has never been able to tell what he does, what kind of job, company, etc. He tries to explain, but it's really vague... 

He lies to me about game related stuff. I caught him lying to me for around a month about something so stupid related to the game and I just don't know what to do anymore. I mean I doubt everything he says. Even makes me think that maybe he lies with more stuff and I just haven't realized. I really want this relationship to work. I was working hard to move to his country and live together. He says he wants that, he says he wants to marry me, he wants to grow old with me, but this kind of attitudes really let me down.

I don't understand why he feels the need to lie to me. He says he is ashamed of who he is, of what he does and doesn't want me to stop loving him. And I try to reassure him, that things like that don't matter to me. I don't care if he still live with his parents, if he is having issues getting a good job. But he still keeps doing it. He knows that I doubt almost everything he says, and accepts it's his fault and wants to try to regain my trust. This makes me really sad and I don't know how to handle this anymore. 

Tldr: My boyfriend is always lying to me about silly stuff and things related to him and now I doubt everything he says to me.",relationships
"So my (24F) boyfriend (23M) and I have been dating for a year and a half. This is the happiest I’ve been in a relationship and we seldom fight. We had a huge fight yesterday though and it was the first time he really hurt my feelings.

The fight we had yesterday was compromised of several different things and many of his points were valid and i agreed with him but, he brought up a strange point that he gets mad when I vent about my dad and my family. He thinks it’s selfish for me to complain because I grew up financially comfortable and had both parents. He grew up on the poverty line with no father. He also told me some people are getting physically abused and a lot of people “fight with their parents”. 

For reference, I am an only child with no other extended family. My dad is a workaholic and avoided me and my mom. This is to the point where in elementary school I told people I don’t have a dad because I assume I didn’t anymore because I never saw him even though my parents were married.

He wouldn’t show up to my events or spend time with us when he could 100% take off. We found out behind closed doors he was eating over his friends houses and taking their children out to eat. We both begged and cried for him to spend time with us numerous times throughout my childhood and he’d do it once and then go back to his old ways. My relationship with my father became worse as I got older. He can only talk about politics and his job. He will result to name-calling me as soon as I disagree with him. I try talking to him about other things but he’ll look away or physically get up. And yes we tried bringing him to therapy and he lied to the therapist and said everything is fine.

It hurts me that my boyfriend thinks these are silly issues and I’m simply being stupid by not putting it behind me and being grateful I have parents. Worst of all, I told him I want to go to therapy to work on coping mechanisms and find some tools to help build a better relationship with my family. He told me it was a waste of time because I’m just going to be “yesed to death” and I just need to change my perspective and move on. I 100% disagree and I was surprised how ignorant and dismissive his view was.

He later apologized saying different methods work for different people but I am very hurt. He has never been like this and he made me feel like I am just a drama queen when I think my concerns are valid. His threshold for negativity might be low perhaps?

He said I can vent to him but don’t “ruin the day with your mood”. I genuinely can only think of one time I did that and ironically he does this too. I told him to tell me if I do that but honestly I just feel awful about myself. I’m scared I don’t have anyone to turn to because anytime I vent I would be bringing him down or he won’t take my problems seriously.

I know he apologized and I accepted it but this just really hurts and I don’t know what to do to get over it.

TLDR: Boyfriend (23M) says my (24F) family problems are silly as people have it worse and my problems bring him down. He told me going to a therapist is useless and I just need to change my perspective and move on. He later apologized and admitted his method won’t work for everyone but I am still very hurt. I fear I can’t vent to him anymore because I won’t be taken seriously or I am ruining his day. How do I move past this?",relationships
"TL;DR I have a hard time feigning interest, and feel I can tell when someone else isn't interested in what I have to say/do and I know when to shut up. Still, when I can feel a level of genuine interest towards my life, I'm able to reciprocate and generate that towards another. With my sister, it all feels strained and fake. If we had met under any other pretext than being family, I don't think we would have hit it off as friends and would have politely gone our separate ways, as strangers do.

To clarify, we've never hated each other or wronged one another in the past. Growing up, I was perhaps the sibling that she got along with the best (aka we never fought but she would have fights with our older Sister or show annoyance towards our younger brother). Still we never showed much real interest in each others' hobbies growing up. Fast forward to today, and we don't message each other outside of saying when we're visiting the other's respective state/city. I do this almost out of a since of obligation, and because I know I'd get crap for it from my mom and oldest sister if I didn't plan a visit while I was there. 

I realize its backwards compared to a lot of people, but I've never felt that my family is more important than others because of blood. I've always felt like I care more about the people who have some level of commonality with me. When that commonality appears to only be the family that I grew up in, it's exhausting to interact. I was bad at communicating with my parents while I was studying out of state because I felt like there wasn't much to talk about besides, ""classes are going well, or I'm dating X and they're great."" Things got harder when I left Mormonism, as one of my parents' favorite talking points was anything church related (anyone familiar with the faith knows that the members' lives heavily revolve around it). I wouldn't want to call because I feel like it would be a waste of both our time. I know this isn't correct, as my mom (especially) would love more calls, but then I feel exhausted trying to talk through them, if that makes sense. My relationship with my parents finally improved after I had kids and bought a house. It felt like we had so much more to easily talk about, whether it was their grandkids growing up, or gardening which is a hobby we both enjoy. 

My relationship with my younger brother has always been great. We have a lot more in common and have always enjoyed each others' jokes/antics. Additionally, we both are the only ones from my immediate family to leave the Mormon faith and have further developed a bond over that. I find myself excited when he's visiting and I message him often.

I'm sure the answer here is to put in the effort to learn more about my sister, and then everything will get easier over time, but it's hard for me to make that initial leap so maybe what I'm asking for here is motivation or your own anecdotes about improving a relationship with a sibling. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",relationships
"For more context, my friend whom I had known for almost 10 years and considered family passed away 3 days ago. It was really hard dealing with it and still is, so I can’t sleep properly and it has affected my sleeping schedule ever since it happened.

Today I stopped crying, but that doesn’t immediately mean that I’m feeling better. I feel so tired and I rlly have no energy so I have been sleeping a lot. The house is also not dirty or anything and I have cooked a couple of meals and worked the little I can as I work from home (but asked for a few days off which I was granted).

Yesterday I woke up from a nap and my bf seemed really bothered. It’s like that gut thing that tell you something is wrong. I ask him if everything is okay and he says he’s fine, “why are you asking that.” I said that I was just wondering and then he started acting out normal. Then today I fell asleep again because I didn’t have proper sleep at night and I wake up and it’s the same thing. He seems like something is bothering him but when I ask he says he’s fine. 

It makes me even more stressed than I already am, it makes the pain more painful, and idk what to do. My best friend died, in the worst way, is it really wrong for me to nap a couple of times?

I don’t know what to do if he won’t tell me what’s wrong.

"We have been dating for approximately 1 year now and the love that I have for him has gradually been decreasing over the past 3 weeks. I work full time with COVID-19 patients and have been really stressed lately with the work load.

I'm just not feeling the love for him right now, sometimes I even feel myself pretending. I know that he loves me dearly and we have had it really really good up until about 3 weeks ago, just as I had started working lots. I am also far from my parents and my home which I think is adding to the anxiety and the sinking feeling which I'm having everyday.

"This is directed towards long-term relationships and marriages.

There is so much emphasis on good communication in a healthy relationship, and a big part of that is honesty. Harm-less inconsequential white-lies are generally thought to be acceptable. But what if for example, it is something that you know will lead to conflict? 

I (20M) personally feel the need to share everything, but that sometimes lead to fights which I think could’ve been avoided if I kept my mouth shut.

" 

Background: Me(28M) and my buddy (28M) go way back to high school. We met in Grade 10 and were simply inseparable after that. We would literally game together, play ball and do everything together. We would literally text each other all day and share every part of our lives with each other. To conclude, we were super tight and always the best of friends.

Present: My buddy got married to a girl(24F) whom i used to really like and i think she was fantastic. But let me say, she is kind of spoiled and always gets her way whether its her family or with my buddy. Lets just say he's the one who always makes a compromise with her and i have to say he is super scared of her. I tried my best to be friends with her but i didn't always get the same response from her. I would say we started hanging out less and talking less which is perfectly fine by me. We would mostly talk during work on Whatsapp chatting but that's about it. I could always sense that she was uncomfortable with our friendship but there is no much i could do.

Apparently i missed a party she threw at a bar and she was super pissed about it. She said she would divorce him if he didn't end up his friendship with me. She said that our friendship was not natural and she was uncomfortable how we would talk everyday and literally talk about everything. Guys are not supposed to be like that. On the surface infront of her, he stopped all conversation with me and i was fine with it. But he started sending me messages when she wouldn't be there or would call me when she would be gone to run errands for example. Its very obvious he misses my presence. I never call him or try to get in touch with him because i am worried his wife will see it and cause issues for him.

Advice Needed: Should i continue talking to him when he texts me or calls me? I usually respond and enjoy my conversation with him but i never call or text him and he has told me never to text/call him. I am just trying to think what my options are? I feel like if i stop talking to him its very rude and that's almost 20 years worth of friendship down the drain.

Can someone please advise me?

Thanks

"TL;DR: Dated for around a month. Stayed in contact most of the lockdown and had plans for after it. He called it off and wanted to stay friends. Hasn't replied to my message in 3 days. 

I (f20) met the guy (m19) on Tinder late Feb. Found out he went to my school, we walked around and talked on campus for an hour then I had to go to class. The next week he texted me if I wanted to go get boba. He picked me up and we spent the whole day together. Went to boba, to the park, and eventually to this popular spot by our college with a mountain view that shows you all the city lights. Conversation was nice and we talked about lots of different things. Music was playing and the view was so nice I got in the moment and ended up kissing him. I'm new to dating (all my relationships have been long distance, you kinda skip the causal dating part in those), so I didn't know what I was doing clearly. It turned into a make-out session, things got heated. But that's as far as we went that night. 

A couple weeks later, Trump declares national emergency. I was in class when my school shut down. Told him my family wasn't gonna be able to pick me up anytime soon and he offered to do it instead. Picked me up and we ended up chilling in his car at the park where we talked, listened to music, watched YouTube videos, and eventually made-out again. Things got heated again, I told him that I wouldn't mind if he came over to my side of the car. Another dumb decision, but I wanted physical contact so deeply considering the guy I liked was actually local and not thousands of miles away. We only got as far as some grabbing while he was on top before he drove me back home. I didn't want to go home that night, I realized that instant I was gonna get attached. I am self aware that I have an anxious attachment style at best. 

Neither of us that night had a clue what the lockdown truly had in store for us. When I realized this could potentially mean several months apart I started worrying. We texted as usual, had never gone a day without since I had known him. My mental health took a turn. I was homeschooled my whole life up until college and this much isolation brought me back to those lonely days. On top of that, I was upset that I was once again unable to physically touch the person I was interested in and even worse I knew I was already attached. I found out he wasn't 100% sure about me. He said he was used to being single but that the more he talks to me the more he felt open to being exclusive. It hurt but I tried to be chill about it. The weeks went by and I started to get irritated that he'd text me 30 minutes to an hour each text. I didn't expect him to drop everything for me, but I knew that a lot of that time was him playing games with his friends because that's what he told me. If we were to call I had to be the one to ask. I communicated how I felt and he said he'd try to get better. He would for a couple of days then go back to slow replies and never once did he initiate calling. 

Fast forward to late March, I've already told him several times that his lack of communication bothers me and that I feel stupid for wanting his attention at this point. He tells me this lockdown has been hard but he does believe he still likes me. I could feel whatever we had falling apart. A couple days later I tell him he needs to figure out what he wants already (tension was high, convos weren't flowing right so I had to get to the point). He tells me that we're two different people. That I'm the type that needs a lot of affection/attention whereas he's more quiet and distant. He said he would like to be friends if I were okay with that, I agreed. We talked every day as usual but it was clear he now embraced not being obligated to text back much. 

Last week he apologized for having forgotten to text me back the earlier night. I told him I didn't expect consistent replies and that it was okay. He said ""but I still feel bad"". This isn't the first time he's told me he feels shitty when he replies slow to me, so I told him in the least petty way possible that that was technically his problem. That I have no control over his consistency and he's going to keep feeling bad for as long as he communicates with me like that. He told me he had a shitty day, I tried to be there for him but he ended up not texting back till the next morning. He'd always get distant when he gets depressed and in general always had his walls up emotionally. We continued texting then that night (3 days ago) was the last time we talked. He hasn't gone into our chat to see my message and he's been watching my Instagram stories. 

It hurts. This on top of the lockdown is killing my mental health. I've been crying every night about him and about so many other things going on in my life. I know I moved fast and now I know not to, but I keep thinking... Was I that bad for what I wanted? Did he really not enjoy my company? I always tried to make him aware that I cared about him and I always tried to make our convos interesting. I don't know who's in the wrong. And I don't know how to make my heart stop hurting, I know I don't want him now knowing how he is but I can't help but feel a tear at my self esteem for him acting like he doesn't even want me as a friend. He wasn't this bad in the beginning, he'd be there to listen when I had shitty days at school and actually acted like he wanted to see me. 

What do you even do in a situation like this? Am I overreacting? Idk I just feel like I need someone to tell me wtf just happened.",relationships
"I honestly really love him, but the relationship isn't working. It has good days and bad, but more bad than good. We live together, and we were just cuddling and he was just casually talking to me but then all I could think about was how in this moment I love him so much but then I also have to end it and I had no idea how I'd be able to do this and just started crying.

"I (27, m) have a partner (31, f) of about 2 years who I connect with sexually very well but the shelter in place has been straining our relationship. We live together so we are seeing each other a lot. Little things were becoming big things and this most recent time is no exception. 

We have been doing an old song and dance where I get triggered by something to become distant, quiet and avoidant. She gets anxious thinking that I'm angry at her and wants some reassurance. My reassurance sounds cold and distant because, well, I am. If this isn't good enough she will usually pressure me into saying something more which is usually a half-baked feeling that is really me lashing out, but we eventually recover.

This doesn't exactly do wonders for our physical intimacy though. I feel like she doesn't respect my emotional process. I feel like it's my responsibility to protect her from her own anxiety whilst I'm also trying to deal with unclear emotions of my own. On top of that she is somewhat defensive so when I try to explain my feelings/ explain what I was thinking then she kind of just invalidates me by saying that's not how she saw the situation. 

But it's not the same when the situation is reversed. If she says something harmless that makes me feel hurt, I'm not allowed to ask for an apology because ""that's not how she saw the situation"". 

This is really hurting my feelings of intimacy. I woke up a recent morning after one such spat. I was feeling horny so when she got out of bed to go to her zoom class I also went to work on my pole. . . . She walked in on me and I, embarrassed, put pants on. She asked why I was putting this sexual energy into myself and not her. I tried saying I was still very much interested in boinking her, I just wasn't feeling very close with her after the last argument we had. She says that we talked it out and cuddled and even fucked afterwards so why would I be masturbating when I could have had sexytimes with her? (Ignoring for a sec that she has a zoom class for school going on right then)

She isn't very willing to see things from my side of the pond and I feel like she's making it my responsibility to save her from her own anxiety.

"Hey reddit. So, I found this sub not too long ago, and I'm kind of in a situation.

So, for a while now, I've had a crush on my bestfriend (13F) and I really think I have feelings for her. I care for her and think she's super sweet and funny, and a lot of other things. Another thing about me is that I've actually been raised Christian, and before I realized my sexuality, I was baptized. Since homosexuality is against my religion, I start to feel a little more awkward when people talk with me about church and God.

Something to note is that my father was also raised to be Christian. But nevertheless, my father is like most other dads. He tells bad dad jokes, he asks those weird ""You got a crush yet?"" questions, and all the other things a typical dad like him would do. The second part is what bugs me. I'm never sure if I should say something like ""Well, I'm kind of interested in girls."", or if I should lie, and tell him that I don't have a crush on anyone.

Usually, I just say I'm not into anyone, and then try to subtly change the subject. As we all know, the virus that's been going around has forced a lot of us to stay inside. When this happened, I feel like my dad started talking about Christianity a little more than usual. I'm starting to wonder if he would except me if he found out about my sexuality, because I know he cares about me, but I feel like he might be forcing this religion on me. Though, he might be suspecting something, too.

To be fair, I wouldn't blame him. I might have been obvious about it at certain times. I know my mom and brother would likely be very supportive, but my dad makes me feel worried to come out. What should I do?

TL;DR I'm a lesbian, and I'm not sure how my Christian father would react if I told him that I have a crush on a girl.",relationships

A bit ago, she was struggling so I told her I’d swing by and help cool her down and bring her back to earth. She said cool, and her ex overheard that and decided to vocalize he was uncomfortable with me being there. Saying that he doesn’t want me there. Her and I knew he was uncomfortable with it and since it’s also her house and I’m her boyfriend it never bothered her. Now, since he’s “vocalized” his issue she says she’d rather not deal with the stress. 

He literally will just go to a separate room and not even say a word to me. He and I haven’t ever had a conflict before.

"Hey all, 

My girlfriend and I had been on and off for 8 years. Last summer we were in a really bad spot so I ended up having sex with another girl I met on social media while we were on a break. Long story short I told her about it and we got bsck together. That was about 4 months ago, she brings it up every single day, She acts like she is never wrong about everything and each time I try to stand up for myself she just says “I took you back after you cheated on me so you have no right to question me about anything” she also tells me I cannot use social media anymore because I met a girl on there and she doesn’t feel comfortable. Everytime I say ima use it again she tells me to go be single and I’m just a cheater (she has 4 social media platforms that she uses daily) 

My thought process is that if she choose to get back with me after that incident, then she cannot continue to treat me the way she does and say that I’m a cheater everytime she gets mad.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Or is she justified because I “cheated”

I hadn't seen evidence showing that she was unfaithful before our breakup, but due to her moving further and working further away, and also due to corona anything is possible. She even posted a snap story of a guy coworker making her laugh the day after she broke up with me. During quarantine, she did become more interested in doing her makeup and working out. I don't know what the true factors behind splitting up are, but it seems like there could be another guy although there's no way to know for certain. If anyone has experience in reconciliation please help me, and feel free to share your thoughts on my plan of 30 days of no contact before reaching out. I'm hoping those with experience in getting back together with en ex will provide insight &amp; guidance.

My ex broke up with me a few days ago, 3 months before our 3 year anniversary, and 20 days before her birthday because she said shes in her 20's and needs to learn how to become independent all the sudden. She told me I didn't do anything wrong and that it was all about her. This really sucks because we would have reached our 3 year anniversary in August. Over Christmas and January time, things were better than ever in my opinion and she was still excited for our future together. She created a scrapbook for me with all of our favorite pictures and memories, and she wrote a very nice heart felt message at the front which describes how in love with me she is, and how she considered herself so lucky to have me and looks forward to our future. I became more sure than ever that she was truly the person I wanted to build a family with and create a future with, which we had already talked about for some time. 

There were so many factors working against us unfortunately, first she had to move back in with her mom and her moms boyfriend which is a very depressing and toxic environment for her. We previously planned to move in and find a place, but our potential roommates split apart and that idea was dead. When she had to move back in with her mom and her moms bf, they moved from 5 mins away from me and were now 45 minutes away. Then in January she accepted a new position at work that relocated her from her local store to a different one also 45 mins away. The transition was hard for her and I supported her mentally because she loved the old store so much. Then Covid happened and I saw her the day before the state shut down, and then again the only times I saw her was in month long intervals. 

To me it is clear that this change in her perspective of our relationship happened after she began her new position.
As I stated, she began her new position in late January, and by march 12 she came to talk to me about breaking off our relationship out of the blue amidst my midterms. I was caught so off guard that I didn't know how to react, and this was my absolute first relationship, and was her first serious relationship too. When she tried to end things between us, it shattered me completely and im sure I made it hard for her to leave, even though that was not my intention. As I said, she claimed she wanted to work on her independence because she said that she was too dependent on me, and she also didn't want to end up stuck in a bad situation like her mom. Her reasons never truly made sense to me because she could work on herself while still in the relationship, and i tried to ask her if there was another guy she was interested in because at least it would make sense, but she said no there wasn't. Eventually after discussing our situation and our lives, she said that she still had feelings for me and didn't want to give up either. Over the next few weeks I was unsure if she meant what she said, and she assured me she would work on it and work on her issues and wouldn't leave me.

Things returned back to a more normal state, except better. We continued talking, calling, and chatting daily until May, and I just tried to work hard on my classwork. I was super stressed and worried about finals, and she even came and got me to help me with my finals and I stayed over for 3 days. It was perfect and didn't feel anything off in the relationship, and I tried my best to be careful not to push her away or pressure her in the relationship, and everything seemed fine. 

Over quarantine, she started doing her makeup more just for fun, and she even started working out which is unlike her, but we've both lost some weight and I just figured she was finally feeling confident about herself again. 

On may 8th, about 2 months after she tried breaking it off in March, she came back over to break up with me again. It caught me off guard again because things seemed better than ever and she assured me she would work on her vague issues, and I cant even remember when we had a fight last. 

This time I was much more composed and didn't break down into a depressed episode. She told me her reasons why, which were once again to become independent, not to end up like her mom, and to work on herself. 

This breakup is the hardest thing I have experienced, and the only thing keeping me going was the fact that she told me once more than she wants to become more independent, and even said without me asking that there wasn't another guy. I didn't think there was. I asked if there was anything I could do to change her mind, she said no. I cant remember specifically how the next part worked out, but she was saying how she didn't want me to wait for her if there was another girl or something. I asked her if she ever sees us getting back together, she said yes she does but she needs at least 6 months to a year. 

The day after hit me harder after I wasn't in shock any longer, and my ex even posted a snap story of a coworker goofing off making her laugh. This could be nothing but will go into more detail later. My girlfriend and best friend was gone from my life. I couldn't even move the next day, yet there she was working like nothing happened and recording and posting another guy ,and I haven eaten in days. 

The way I have been able to power through the first few days was on the idea that she could've been genuine in breaking it off to work on herself, and was actually telling the truth about working on herself. I decided that I could accept this. And I could work to better myself too. 

I decided I wanted to use this negative situation to better myself, maybe her and I would find our way back to each other after some more independent personal growing. After all, the breakup went about as well as someone could hope, she said she still loved me, and her and I were respectful with each other. 2 days after the breakup, I had already updated my resume, sent numerous fresh job applications after being unemployed just over a year, developed a fresh plan for my future, and began to reflect on our relationship.

I began to search for reasons of why this would happen since the answers weren't too clear to me since I apparently did nothing wrong, and was thinking of how I could've pushed her into this decision without realizing and decided it was possible that she simply lost her attraction for me since I wasn't as active and ambitious as when we met and worked together. She never mentioned my employment as an issue, or that I was living at home while finishing my degree. I still made some money on the side with under the table work so I wasn't trying to be a lazy slob, but i have a hard time juggling school and work. Also I mentioned previously, she desperately wanted my help to get into a stable living environment but i was unable financially to commit to that.

After reflecting more on the changes this year, and by analyzing Instagram posts and discussing the situation in depth with friends, it seems possible that there could potentially be another guy at her new store that she did it for. I never suspected anything until last night because of how invested in our future and relationship she was by Christmas and January. She started the new store in late January, tried to break things off in march, but finally broke up with me on may 8th. She could've been trying to shield me from the truth, but that hurts so much worse to think that and i figure she would've respected me enough to be straight up honest no matter how hard.

I am working on myself and am going through a rough time because she was both my girlfriend, and my best friend since just a while before we started dating. Shes such a beautiful person who puts others before herself daily. Shes a hard working girl who has great work ethics, and is more attractive now than ever after shedding some weight. I was totally ready to get on one knee once I obtained the financial ability. I would like to reconcile with her, but I'll move on if I have to. I feel like we've been together forever, but also like it was no time at all. I understand our old relationship is dead and over, and I don't disagree that we both could work on ourselves on an individual level, but I still would like answers behind the decision and to work towards reconciliation if possible.

As I said, the breakup was calm and the situation wasn't chaotic, and after we are still friends on social media. She didn't block me and I didn't block her. I made a post on Instagram stating what my old plan was, how it wasn't good enough and unfair, and described my life situation &amp; how I planned to change the course of my future. I talked about my applications, how i started working out and would begin to eat a healthy diet again. I then described what I learned. The post was entirely about me, but I also knew she would see it. I wanted to show her without talking to her that I was also taking steps to better myself. Within a few hours, she posted on her Instagram ""deleting the insta app, we'll see if I ever re-download it....
.."". I was not expecting this, and I don't know what to think. 

Some say that it is over over and that she is done with me and she was just trying to be nice so she can be with other guys &amp; have sex without a guilty conscience. A couple people said that I should just let her do her thing and she may come back on her own. The concerning and yet comforting fact is that we've never broken up before now. We have always worked through our differences. 

I'm so conflicted. I was/am truly and deeply in love with her, and i desire a reconciliation even if its some time down the road. I wont and cant wait forever though. I am considering contacting her after 30 days to discuss our relationship and gain a better understanding of what happened. I'm hoping sincerely that she isn't going to start having meaningless sex, at least not yet. If she will meet me to discuss the relationship, I hope to be able to grow from the feedback, and whether if she expresses that it isn't over or that it is, I will at least have an answer. 

I tried to be as specific and provide as much detail as possible, but this post has grown quite large already. I know it is impossible to say what the future holds, but I hope people with insight and experience with relationships that got back together could share some of their wisdom, thoughts, and opinions on the matter. If anyone has questions feel free to ask, I've tried to be an open book because i feel like there's only a small window of opportunity to achieve reconciliation if at all possible. Please pray for me, I haven't been able to eat since and my life is in disarray.",relationships
"Hey guys, sorry to bother you guys, but need help.

Thing is, we got into relationship when we were very young i.e 17. There was this guy who she knew from her locality. He became good friend with her and also introduced me as her BF. But, all of a sudden, this guy starts liking her. And, he goes around to people saying she is her GF. This happened when we were 19 n that guy too.

I warned her never to talk to this guy or be anywhere near him. Now this comes, becomes good friends with her parents. Helps her parents on their business. But, still I don't feel comfortable. I tell her just greet hello and that's it. I don't like u being anywhere near him. Even she agrees to it.

But, what got me pissed off is, she goes to his house for a musical jam together with her sister. It happened when we had argued. When i knew she did this, it really pissed me off. She says not to I can't interfere whom she can talk and can't talk to. She says that guy did it when he was stupid. N she doesn't want to hold on to what he did. My point is, who wud feel comfortable? Doesn't she have self-respect? I really feel disrespected and feels like breaking up. Am i tripping?  I don't know what to do. 

Tldr; there was this guy was walking around saying my gf is his girl even though my gf had already introduced me to him as a bf. Three years gone since that happened. Now, he is close to her parents. Bt, still I don't feel comfortable with him around. N i said not to do anything more than greetings, she agreed as well. Bt, she went on his house for a musical jam when we were arguing. I feel disrespected and want to break up bt, is it right?",relationships
"I know it wasn’t cheating but was it a huge breach of trust and respect or am I over reacting?

I (17M) have been in a relationship for with my girlfriend, who is also 17, for about 9 months. Before we started talking she had a really good guy friend who she was really really close to but they had a falling out about 11 months ago. After this my girlfriend and I started dating and she would would tell me if he texted her, for example about 4 months into our relationship he texted her “I miss you xx” which she said she left on opened as well as a birthday message.

However during quarantine I started to get annoyed with how little we saw each other (in Australia you are permitted to see a partner) and asked her the why. She said she didn’t want to see me as much because her friends weren’t seeing their boyfriends (which I thought was a bit weird as she never really was a sheep or cared what others did) and later said that it was because her mother, who had cancer a while back, maybe over a year, had a compromised immune system (which was obviously fair enough, but I didn’t understand why she didn’t say that first or earlier). Anyway we really cut down how much we saw each other.  

Yesterday we were snapping each other and she had left me on delivered for 2 hours so I was wondering if she had been on or not and saw (on her snap maps) that she was at her old guy friends house who lives down the road from her. When she replied to my snaps again and was back home I could tell she was drunk and waited to see if she would tell that she went there. When I knew she wasn’t going to tell me I asked if she’d been to his house and she replied with a picture of her with a huge smile and writing saying “MAYYBEEE”. I waited till she was sober to keep texting (snapping) her and she said went over there to find out why they had a falling out (which although would bother me I’d understand). The problem i have is she was also at his drinking until she got drunk and told me she didn’t want to tell me because I’d “be pissed off either way”. So she knew I’d be unhappy with her going there and did it anyway. She didn’t even tell me they had texted at all like she had before. I’m also very irritated at the fact that she told me she didn’t want see me during the quarantine when I’m her boyfriend but she’ll happily go to this guys house.

I feel like this was a huge breach of trust and respect and was something I thought she’d be mature enough to not do. I’ve even begun questioning my relationship as a whole. Am I overreacting or is this a genuine reason for me to be angry?

TL;DR  My girlfriend went to her old guy friends house without telling me (or intending to tell me) and got drunk but doesn’t even come to my place because of quarantine.

"I guess today I'm just looking for a bit of advice.

I don't really have any close friends, and right now I could really use some. The only person I really am close with is my boyfriend and I feel like this is slightly unhealthy, plus, we had a rocky few months (see my post history). I have a two friends that I'll text once in a while that I used to be close with, but with one of them I have nothing in common with anymore, and the other lives across the world. Neither make much effort to remain in contact with me.

I have always had trouble making friends, and staying friends with people. In the past I've had falling outs with the friends I've gotten close with. I know this is partly my fault, I can be a lot at times and I used to be (I’ve been working on it) stubborn to a fault. But at the moment I don't really have any friends and I just feel very alone.

I've been told to meet friends through hobbies, but I also don't have many hobbies. I didn't really develop hobbies growing up as I used to be a competitive dancer, so all my spare time was on that. Now, other than playing animal crossing, I don't really have any real hobbies.

I'm not in school anymore, which is where I used to make friends, and I work from home. (Even pre- this situation with the world, I worked from home half time and in the office the other half). Even when I was in school, I always had a lot of trouble making friends. I guess I just need some advice. I feel as if I'm a pretty unlikable person based on my past history with friends and falling outs. But I really try. I don't know what's wrong with me and why people don't like me (and I know people on reddit won't be able to tell me obviously).

I try to live my life the best I can and be kind to everyone. I've been told that my kindness seems disingenuous or ""fake"" - that no one could really be that kind/selfless. Repeating this myself sounds awful (like I'm bragging) but I really just don't know what to do. I grew up with an abusive older sister and mom so I learned to be kind to everyone as I never want to make anyone feel like they made me feel. It may seem ""fake"" but I don't really understand. It isn't hard to be kind to other people or just to be a generally decent person.

Sorry this is all over the place and a lot of information.

"I (22F) have never had a FWB relationship before, but I’m in the beginning stages of one now with a guy (21M) I dated for about two months. We decided that we’d be better off as friends with benefits since neither of us saw a relationship working out longterm between the two of us, the sex is great, and we get along quite well. 

I want to have clear boundaries with my FWB, but I don’t want to complicate the situation too much by putting limitations on things (e.g. I want to stay safe in terms of sexual health but don’t want to push for sexual exclusivity). 

If you’ve had a ‘successful’ FWB arrangement with set boundaries, what were they and how were they communicated effectively? Those who’ve had success without boundaries, how did you navigate the relationship?

"My partner and I have been dating for just over 2 years. We started dating when she was a sophomore in high school and I was a junior in high school. Later that year, I decided that I would be going to a certain university out of state. This decision wasn't made with my partner involved because we had barely been dating for a year and she hadn't even started looking at colleges. My girlfriend is just finishing her senior year at high school (we went to the same high school). We have already had some experience doing the long-distance relationship, as it was what we did when I was in college for a year. 

Her family isn't the most financially set, so she can't go to the school that I'm currently going to. She's going to a smaller, private school that's in a different state from our home state and the state that my college is in, so we'll be pretty far away, about 9 hours by car.  She had mentioned me going to that university before, but I had already chosen the one that I am currently going to. 

Now that we've been dating for over 2 years, we've really begun to think about the next few years of our lives and how it's going to work out. She thinks that these next few years before we potentially get married are going to be very difficult if I don't transfer to her college. In some ways I agree, but I personally wasn't bothered by the distance as much as she was while I was at college. That isn't to say that I like being away from her, it's just that we seemed to make it work for the most part. 

Now, The solution sounds very easy from here. Just transfer to her college and be with her. But I am heavily supportive of my parents financially, as they are helping me pay for my first year or two of college, while the rest are scholarships and coming out of my own pocket. So I brought up  the idea of me transferring to her university and they freaked out. They are very very against me doing that. Grades and degrees are very, very important to them, and they don't want me to transfer to a smaller private university. It sounds bad when I put it like that, but they truly mean well. They are more than willing to help my partner and I be able to meet while we're both at college, and they definitely are pushing for our relationship. They just think that it's a mistake to leave my good college that I worked hard to be accepted into for a girl. And for the most part, I agree with them, but  I still can't get it out of my head that I'm making the wrong choice here. I still want to be with her, and spending every day with her working on school work sounds pretty great, but I just feel stuck here. 

I know that If I do end up transferring to her college, my parents will be very upset about it and I don't want to do that to them, nor do I want to hurt my partner by being apart from her for the next few years before we can get married.

Some extra info: We are both religious (especially her parents), so living together is not an option. Our family values are VERY different. Her parents think I should transfer to her college, and mine do not. We are not able to get married before graduation, as we don't think it's a good idea and neither do our parents. Right now, we don't have any plans for me to transfer, but she keeps making comments about it because she's not over the argument thats been happening about it and she still wants me to go despite what my parents want and partially what I want. I'm personally torn between what she wants and what my parents want, and it's why I've taken to reddit. It's already to late to be considered for transferring next year, but there is always the year after to think about (my junior year).

Please give me some advice. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have nowhere to go. Thank you for whatever advice you can give me.

TL;DR: My girlfriend is going to a different college than me next year and wants me to transfer to her college since she isn't financially set enough to go to the one that I'm at. My parents are very much against it though and I'm torn between them. I need advice as to where to go from here or what to do about this situation.",relationships

We met again after a year, online again. We became good friends but by hen he already had been in a relationship and broken up. We met a few times, stopped talking, started talking again. But eventually I fell in love with him. Wasn't sure of how I should tell this to him and when. 

I got to know he was moving to another city for work. I begged him to meet me. But I was too shy to tell him on face. So when I got back home I texted him and told him that I'm in love with him. And he told me he was too. But he won't date me. 

He had a terrible breakup in his previous relationship and was heart broken. Also long distance is a head ache. So now he just asks me to bottle up my feelings. 

He won't stop talking to me, hated it when I don't talk to him. But asks me to bottle up my feelings. And he does it too. He hasn't moved to the new city due to the lockdown. But he soon will. I love him a lot. I just want to express my feelings properly to him and want the same back from him.

"TLDR: I am dating a guy who is amazing. Two past abusive relationships are making me act in strange and mistrustful ways. What are some ways to not do this?

I want to know some tips on how to trust and live in the moment with my current partner. We have been dating for months and recently moved in together. I am scared and consistently find myself unable to talk or share my feelings with him. I am so happy to be with him and spend my days with him but I constantly second guess his feelings for me or his intentions with us. My two past partners were incredibly abusive. One cheated on me often and blamed me for it when I found out. One of them was violent; I lost my hearing in that relationship. It's like I'm waiting for my current to cheat on me, to tell me he doesn't like me around, to tell me I'm too old or that he has better options, to accuse me of starting fights or gaslighting me. I am so scared and really I don't trust myself and my own judgement of what is healthy and what isn't. Clearly I was dumb enough to get tricked before and stay with people who hurt me.

I am out of work and don't qualify for unemployment. I live in a rural area and am spending my time looking to continue my career. There is absolutely no counseling in this area, especially with COVID stuff happening. There are no domestic abuse organizations close by. Online therapy is way too expensive for someone with no paycheck or money.

"Okay so, I’m (20NB) are currently in a polyamorous relationship with a 20F and 21NB who are both dating each other as well (not super relevant but important to mention). We are all very happy together and I love them both so much, we have been together now about 6/7 months ish. However, they are both at a very high class, internationally prestigious university in the U.K. I am not. 

I’m not stupid, I’m pretty average! I got fairly middle ground grades at school without doing much revision work and am doing well at the art degree I’m currently taking. I’m not super fussed about being unacademic, everyone has different talents and my lay elsewhere. I’m pretty good at reading people, and I’m great in unfamiliar social situations (which neither of them are great at). 
But I’m not great at puzzle solving, and I’m a slow learner too. I got to my A levels and suddenly the work was too complicated for me to keep up with, even with long hours of studying, and I accepted I’d reached my limit. Iv also got ADHD and though that isn’t a marker of intelligence it makes listening to the long intensely academic conversations they have really difficult. My brain zones out, even with actively trying to pay attention. And when I am following I can’t keep up, they are just above a level I can’t pass. 

Normally that wouldn’t bother me with friends but, their degrees are so important to both of them. Their intelligence defines their whole lives, it’s their passion and what drives them, it’s what they value in the world. And I just, I guess I wonder what they see in me? 

I know they both love me, and that my faults don’t bother them enough for them to start dating me. But I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. For them to realise I can’t hold intelligent conversation with them, that when we play board games together I lose every time, that I struggle with money and numbers, that I make very simple spelling mistakes. There are so many times a day where I have to go “Oops sorry!! Didn’t realise!” Or “I’m sorry can you explain that again?” And eventually it will stop being cute. I’m pretty impulsive and I feel like that hides a lot of my unintelligence behind a shield of not taking long enough to think about things. But eventually they will notice, and then it will eventually stop being endearing. 

I guess I’m posting here looking for other people who are dating someone who’s significantly smarter than them. Mostly stories of people who’ve made it work? Any advice would of course be also much appreciated regardless of your experience! I know it’s something that I’m gonna have to come to terms with, and I really want to make this work, but I just can’t think my way out of it (pun unintentional). I just keep going around and around that I’m not smart enough to be dating them, and eventually they will break up with me and look for their intellectual counterpart. 
I’d rather get over this on my own than talk to them about, they would be upset if they knew I was thinking about it like this, and they are also both in the middle of their finals rn and way to busy for me to be bugging them about my emotional hang ups. 

Thank you for reading!

"As stated in the title, my boyfriend (26M) and I (26F) had a conversation about our future last night. We've been together for almost 2 years now and this conversation has come up a couple of times. Essentially, we are both at a point in life to begin thinking about marriage and we want to begin that phase of life. 

Some background: pretty much from the beginning, it's felt like the universe is working against us. We've had stresses from family, past relationship trauma we're trying to process, and mental health struggles. We've taken turns caring for each other in hard times and both had moments where we felt like we're carrying the other in an exhausting way. Through all of that, we've also had many fun, exciting and amazing moments where we felt loved and happy.

So last night, our conversation basically boils down to this: I'm ready to jump in completely. I recognize that we have our tough moments and I'm willing to go through those with him. I don't feel sure that everything will be easy, but I know he and I are a great team and I want him by my side. On the other side, he is seeing things that have been tough from the past couple of years and he feels scared to make a big decision. He feels stuck - he doesn't want to break up because we're happy together, but he can't quite make the decision to marry me right now. I will never rush him into making a choice, and I don't see it as a waste of my time in any way. We're happy together. 

I'm really not sure what to feel, but I'm feeling a lot of hopelessness and anxiety. I'm wondering if anyone who has gone through a similar moment can talk me through it. If you're married and it took you a long time to feel right about it, maybe let me know what you're e

TL;DR: I'm ready to marry my boyfriend and commit to supporting and loving him through life. He loves me and has supported me through a lot in our relationship, but after 2 years he doesn't feel like he can make a decision about it right now. I'm looking for some empathy and advice.",relationships
"I’ve moved around my whole life yet my South Asian parents have managed to hold on to their religious and cultural traditions. They don’t care if I bring home a foreigner, as long as he’s Muslim. I’ve been dating my bf (an amazing white Christian guy) for a year and I’ve met his lovely parents yet my parents still don’t know about my bf and I’m not going to tell them for at least another year. 

It makes me quite sad to see how wonderful and accepting his family is because it makes me wish that he could receive the same treatment from my family but I know they won’t be able to see past religion. My older siblings are also dating non-Muslims and my parents still don’t approve of their SO’s which makes me even more hopeless about my situation. I’d never force my bf to convert because I’ve seen how close he is to God and I can’t/don’t want to take that away from him. 

I guess what I’m hoping for are success stories from people who were in similar situations like mine. I’ve read a lot online and I’d hate to be estranged from my family as a consequence of wanting to love my man. Is there hope for me? 

TLDR; dating a Christian guy who my Muslim South Asian parents won’t approve of. If anyone went through the same scenario and got their parents to accept their SO, I’d love to hear how it happened and what you did.",relationships
"We \[35F, 36M\] have been together more than half our lives, married for 12 years. We have always been able to hold it together but the relationship is no longer making me happy, but not for lack of trying. I have determined that I want to leave because I believe that I could be happier on my own or with someone else (TBD). 

Our issues generally relate to growing apart as individuals, we have almost nothing in common, including friends, and our sexual needs are polar opposite.

My spouse is a very good person and a great father to our kids, who are both under 6. I want to hear about how I can move through the process of planning for the split and going through with as little damage to my spouse and children as possible. My enduring feeling (which has been in me for years) is that I would rather model a healthy and respectful pursuit of happiness than to stay in an unfulfilling relationship because the kids were young. I was brought up with a single parent and don't believe it is a life of less. I understand that many aspects of my life will be more difficult, and I can accept that by splitting I will be giving up a number of my creature comforts that I enjoy now. 

He makes plenty of money and has family in town that he can stay with while things are sorting themselves out. I don't make enough money to pay for our home by myself, but hoping that he would consider maintaining some of the home costs as his contribution to childcare.

I have a counselor lined up for myself to start next week, whose practice involves relationships, splits and children, so prepared on that front. 

What advice does this sub have for me?

"I’ve been dating my gf for about 4 months now and lately because of quarantine it got really tense and arguments were frequent for a bit. But we started trying to understand each other more and now whenever there’s arguments it’s more calm and she’s been a bit more supportive but that’s how I see it. My friends have said that I could do way better sometimes and I get really frustrated because I realize that she doesn’t seem to be the most mature person in the world. She can be very emotionally immature and the only reason things got better is because I was extremely patient and constantly told her that if she had a problem with me to just discuss it with me so it doesn’t blow up in our faces in the form of an argument. There were times where i was having a mental breakdown and she left me on delivered after she got annoyed with me for crying for help which then led to a panic attack, there was the time she blocked me and cut me off temporarily because she was annoyed with how i was joking around with my friend on a discord server. In general she just runs away from her problems instead of facing them head on which can be understandable with things like hw but when it starts affecting our relationship and my mental health it just bothers me. My friends say that they don’t like how she sometimes fails to be supportive and just gets mad at me for the dumbest of things. On top of that there’s the whole being away from her Bc of quarantine and missing her physically. we’ve already been pretty intimate physically in terms of seeing her exposed so to speak, and Bc of the whole quarantine there’s been times I’ve just been sexually frustrated due to just wishing I could see her. However, she can be rlly prude about sending stuff like that which is completely understandable so I try not to take offense. But at the same time, it just feels uncomfortable Bc not only do I feel unsatisfied physically in this relationship due to quarantine, I sometimes feel unsatisfied mentally with how she’s approached me venting towards her and what not. She’s gone about defending her friends and treating them like they’re untouchable and dismisses their flaws while being biased against me and pointing out my flaws when I’m venting to her about how it makes me fell hurt about how some of her friends think I’m not good enough. Idk it just hurts to think about sometimes. She’s gotten bette lately on that to be quite honest but  I can’t help but think about it sometimes. Lately I also have made friends with a nice girl who’s a bit older (19) and I felt uncomfortable with how at times I felt attracted to her Bc she just seemed to smart and mature with being in college and all. It disgusts me Bc I don’t like the idea of being that way while in a relationship and I would NEVER cheat, but I sometimes wish my gf were a lil more mature. ima bring it up again to her so could talk about it and grow our relationship more but like... it makes me sad when she gets frustrated at the silliest of things over her insecurities or just immature habits of wanting to cancel away her problems. I genuinely believe that I love her, but idk till what point will it be the difference between me being patient.. and me being on the bad side of a toxic relationship. She’s so caring and amazing but.. that other girl made me feel better in a way that I wish my gf did at times. I don’t have feelings like that at all for the other girl and I will made sure I keep it strictly on the basis of friends and cancel any attempts to try and flirt or what not Bc ik it will be fake if i try to go for her even if I was single. I just need help.. idk what to think anymore.. and with this whole quarantine I just feel so alone. I know I shouldn’t break up with her just yet and despite wanting to try hard to preserve it i don’t know when will it be too much.

TL;DR my gf has bad and immature toxic habits that have gotten a bit better but are still there at times and this other girl I’ve befriended had me attracted by her maturity and the way she went about things and I know I am a loyal boyfriend so I’m not worried about that (however I’m still sickened to admit that I felt that way) but I just have my doubts about my relationship and do not know when enough is enough and to call it quits.


Update: I confessed to the other girl about my guilty attraction towards her and she’s completely understanding about it and is going to continue to support me as a friend. As for my girlfriend, I told her that we should take a break because of AP Exams so I could focus more on my academics and my mental health for the time being and that we will resume once these stressful exams are over. I told her that I’ll try to stay more patient and that I know we can get through these troubled times only if she puts in work for the relationship as well. She was also understanding and said she feels guilty for always hurting me and it seems to me that she wants to be better. Welp, ima go study and do my bs remote learning, see y’all.",relationships
"My bf (48M) and me (31f) have been together for 2 years,  but lately constantly butting heads because of my sarcasm. I don't even realise I do it. I am very quick witted and Have always been but lately my boyfriend has been very rude to me. I have just put 2 and 2 together and he has been giving it to me full force.

Now I am at the point where I dont even want to be around him because I'm worried that I will upset him. How do I fix this?

"So a little background here because the story is weirder than it seems. We met right when we both started out sophomores years of high school, but I had known of her throughout freshman year. We naturally got closer and eventually I caught feelings. She’s a very flirty person, which naturally drew me to her, but I’ll admit sometimes it seemed like she was into any guy that would walk by her path. About a year went by after that and I asked her out at the beginning of Junior year, she said yes and we went on a series of lovely dates, everything seemed perfect.

But here’s where it gets weird 

Yesterday we had our daily zoom call and the topic of masturbation had come up. We had always sorta danced around sexual topics in the past. She was fine kissing and hugging me but never anything more, which I was fine taking things slow. She asked if I masturbate to other girls, I said yes and wasn’t ashamed of it, figured it was natural for a guy my age and all that. I ask the same question back and she seems visibly flustered, before saying she did the same. I tried to steer the conversation somewhere else, but she stayed on the topic, asking me if I like watched videos or picture or whatever. I figured everyone was the video type so this caught me a bit off guard. I’ll spare the details of what I said to keep this more PG. She sorta laughed it off and said she wasn’t really into videos. When I pressed further she said she would usually just lay in bed and scroll through, in her own words “hot guys Instagram pages”

Huh, weird 

I guess my brain only rationalized it as being male porn stars or actors, so I tried to ask who struck her fancy, in a joking sorta way. 

But then things got way weirder 

She started listing a few names, but to my shock, they were mostly guys who lived in our area or hell even went to our school. Some of the guys I knew. I was completely taken aback by this and said I had to go and left the call shortly after. I’ve felt sick for the past hour or so, I’m completely flustered and have no idea what to do. Is this normal? Am I getting worried over nothing? Am I the issue? I just have no idea what to do, like should we break up. I’m just so tired and confused and stressed about the whole thing, I regret even asking 

TL;DR: GF masturbates to pictures of other guys she knows, should I be worried?",relationships
"We've been friends for many years, we're sexually attracted to each other but not emotionally attracted to each other so we don't date but we occasionally hook-up whenever we're both single. Obviously this makes things a bit weird for the people we date, but I digress.

Whenever my friend is dating someone she basically turns into a bully to me. She **constantly** ""jokes"" about things like how 'thin' my dick is, or how 'fat' I've gotten over the quarantine, or how big her boyfriends dick is, or how 'big and strong' he is, etc. I have never actually met the guy, she jokes like this when it's just the two of us.

I'll admit I'm a bit jealous of her boyfriend, and I've made that clear to her and told her to chill out with the ""my boyfriends dick"" shit, but she doesn't stop.

I don't understand why she gets like this... She's an incredible girl whenever she's single. She's a huge sweetheart and has helped me through some of the hardest points in my life, but whenever she starts dating someone she just turns into a bit of a jackass.

TL;DR: Best friend is great until she gets a boyfriend then starts to be an ass to me. What should I do about this?",relationships
"I’ve had horrible anxiety and a bad gut feeling about my fiancé for years. However, for the most part he’s very caring, loving, and is always there for me when I’m down. We have a good sex life, my friends and family like him, he’s also very responsible. The problem is he has abandonment issues (his mother tried to commit suicide in front of him when he was 8, and she moved to another country and didn’t come back into his life untill he was in his 20s). I myself have a host of issues including severe anxiety - I was raised with a narc/abusive father and abusive mother so my threat detection level is very high. 

I can’t figure out if my gut feeling about my boyfriend is accurate because of my upbringing where I sometimes unnecessarily think everything is going to turn into a worst case scenario. I don’t know if I can handle my boyfriends abandonment issues; he has all those good qualities but I’ve observed he’s very impatient (not with me) with the internet, waiting in lines, waiting for people. 

What makes me second guess is because He’s also got a temper which triggers me but his temper never reaches the point where he yells or screams, or swears. He has a tendency to love bomb and I have to ask him to stop cause it makes me feel Uncomfortable. He can be very dramatic. However, he’s made a lot of improvements over the past year and he goes to therapy/meditates to help him. 

It’s not easy for me to leave this relationship because he’s also the same religion and has the same values as me which is hard to find. And he’s really trying to be more patient. 

Tl;dr I’m just so confused. I can’t make a decision about whether my gut feeling is right about my fiancé, because my gut has always been overactive and paranoid. I’ve also struggled to make any decision in my life and im overcome with anxiety.",relationships
"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for over a year now, and I'm dreading going back to live with her after the lockdown ends (we've de facto lived together for about a year). She isn't abusive or anything of the sort, but the time I've spent living with her has been exhausting emotionally. She is prone to mood swings and has a very depressive personality (she might have depression but she has never been diagnosed). I love her, but every day we either have a fight or I don't do something right and that leads to her spiralling usually despite my attempts to help, resulting in hours of time spent trying to cheer her up, and sometimes leads to her self-harming. I'm at a stage in my life where my old friends are harder and harder to meet up with and stay in contact with, and I also have to be extremely productive with college work, but I don't feel I can do that while living with her.

These past weeks living at my parent's have been some of my most productive in a very long time, and my mental health is also better than it has been in some time.

Many people will say 'just don't live with her then', but she has been telling me she will self harm if we stay apart for much longer because of how lonely she is at the moment, so that doesn't seem like an option? Is there a way to discuss this with her without leading to her spiralling? Or perhaps a way to sensitively suggest getting mental help (I have tried to gently suggest before but she gets very offended by the idea of me labelling her 'mental')?

"TL;DR I have no idea if my depression is acting up or if I want nothing to do with my boyfriend. I don't see myself with anyone else but I don't want to be around him. 

Background: I (23f) have been with my boyfriend (23m) for a year and a half. Lately he has moved in, something I have never done with anyone besides my parents, and we even got a puppy together. We were so excited for this quarantine because we love being inside and being alone with each other. 

The last two or three weeks, though, things have been hard. I feel like everything I do or say angers him. He doesn't get violent he just gets an attitude and is rude and sarcastic. He always says that if something is wrong to tell him, so I have been trying to tell him that i might be losing feelings. I am depressed. I don't feel okay being cooped up like i thought I would be. And each time I bring up a problem i have, he gets annoyed or mad, or something. Because of that, i have essentially self isolated in my room while he hangs out in the living room. i have been incredibly depressed and I don't even want to get out of bed. I only get out of bed to pee or shower. I barely eat. I wake up and just want to go back to sleep again. 

He's been ""checking"" on me (saying, ""do you want to talk yet?"") but I don't want to tell him how I feel because I know it's just going to turn into him getting mad and me getting sad and locking myself in my room again. 

I also feel I should mention that he is a kind man. He really is. He's sweet and caring and thoughtful. At least he used to be. The last few months it's like he thinks he doesn't have to try anymore. And then with all of this going on, it makes it worse. I'm longing for the man I fell in love with. 

Genuinely, I don't think I would be happier alone, and I don't see myself with anyone else in the future. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm asking for advice, suggestions, what have you. Has anyone gone through this? Did you make it out with your SO okay?",relationships
"Well where do I even begin? I came out 2 weeks ago to my parents about me being gay as well as my girlfriend. This was a obviously a huge deal for me as I have never come out to them before in any capacity as well as never telling them about me dating anyone ever.

While this initially went well things drastically took a turn for the worst. My girlfriend got a DUI 2 years ago and when you look up her name this is public information. She paid her dues and it is behind her but it is still online as it is still on her record.

My parents called me yesterday saying they found out about this and that she has “completely ruined her life” and “will never get a job” which is ridiculous because she has a great job. They then went on about how she is “bad news” and I need to “watch my back”. When I tried explaining the situation and how she had a good job and it’s in the past they didn’t want to hear any of it and just told me to watch myself because this is a “bad kid”.

When I told my girlfriend she immediately went off and went into a “fuck your parents” monologue. I felt that this was extremely disrespectful because my parents are just trying to look out for me at the end of the day and while the circumstances of her DUI weren’t as bad as they sound she was still driving drunk and could have put someone else in danger. She also doesn’t want to talk about it because it’s “triggering”.

Now I’m just at a standstill because I feel like both my parents and my girlfriend are both not reacting how they should while I put myself and the relationship with my parents at risk. While my parents are wrong in not listening to anything I say at the end of the day what my girlfriend did was extremely wrong and could have seriously hurt others. While I love my girlfriend and want to be with her she isn’t being supportive after I put the relationship between my parents and I on the line and victimizing herself in this situation isn’t helping at all.

Any advice? Please help!

"""I think it would be good to lose some weight.""

I know. I know. And I even let it slip after having 2 kids, in a tiny house with no real space to exercise, during a quarantine. I'm awesome.

I don't know how useful it is to give all the layers behind why it came out. Just know it has less to do with my attraction to her which doesn't waver, and more to do with what I see as a tendency to feel victimized by life's circumstances. I love her and want to support her in feeling more control over her life.

So the main question I think is what is the best way to ""passively"" support her and be loving, while also ""actively"" support her (for example doing some family exercises together?) This question really goes beyond the weight, but that's one thing to write about to keep the post focused.

It feels like an obvious answer is ""you can't have both. You need to just be a shoulder for her to lean on."" I just want her to be happy. I'm worried that if I simply am there as a loving support, the things that keep her feeling stressed and powerless to take on will just remain.

TL;DR Told my wife I think she should lose weight. I know this was wrong. I want to clean up the damage, but feel challenged because of the conflicting roles of passive loving support vs. actively helping. I want her to be happy. Not sure that passive support is a long term fix.",relationships
" So my boyfriend (20) and I (F,19) have had an interesting past. We broke up and got back together. We both say that we feel like the other is the one for us, soul mates, etc. Anyone who sees him look at me can tell he loves me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, we were basically living together before coronavirus. Now that coronavirus hit, he moved back to his parents. I moved into my own apartment and had been bugging him to move in with me. He finally had a point about two weeks ago where he was upset and overthinking everything and said he didn't want to be with anyone right now. I told him to a week to think. the night before he told me this, I was talking with two friends and was curious about Facebook dating. I had a feeling that he was going to break up with me and made an account out of curiosity and for fun, mainly because I thought it was going to be over. He texted me two hours after our conversation and we talked about how to make our relationship better. I didn't tell him about the dating profile at all. Everything's been good until today.

&amp;#x200B;

 His parents won't let him move in with me, or go back to work or even see me until they go back to work and he doesn't have any homework. His mom also gave him a 10pm bedtime and I watched his mom tell him he couldn't stay up til midnight to watch a show. I've been kinda telling him that his parents are a bit crazy, even tho I love them, and that they're controlling him and not treating him like an adult, something a lot of my friends see. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, we were talking and I told him that I had made the profile and cried and apologized and he said he wasn't mad. Today he seemed quiet so I asked if he was mad. He said he's just processing everything right now and that he's not sure what to think and having doubts about my personality (we've been together again about 7 months). I don't know what to say or do and need help. Everyone says I didn't cheat on him, but I felt so guilty doing it and everything and his ex did cheat on him. I did tell the two guys I talked to that I had a boyfriend. I'm not sure what to do or where to go from here. I want to give him space if he needs it, but I don't want to lose him again. I love him with all my heart.

At the moment the media is full of some celebrity cook who has turned out to be a hardcore conspiracy theorist. So I cracked a joke about his theories. People laughed, we moved on to business. A few hours after the call I received a text message by a coworker who took part in the call. She asked me if I was alluding to her with my comment about vaccination. I was pretty confused. She went on that I was a spiteful person because she told me things in confidence. I was even more confused. Yes we had some heart to heart talks lately but nothing was said that could be linked to my comment. I tried to call her immediately. She didn't answer. I texted her and apologized.

"I’ve [26F] posted on other subs about my ex-boyfriend [33M] before. I keep breaking up with him and he calls me the next day as if nothing happened and has even showed up to my parent’s house to “make sure I wasn’t with another man.” All of this started over $20. 

The last time I posted about my ex-boyfriend, it was about how he sent a loan shark/drug dealer to my parents house where my daughter and I live because he owed the man money and promised him a part of MY DISABILITY CHECK. Okay so that obviously became a fight. I told him that I wanted all of my money back because I’m tired of him always “needing” me. I paid for him to get his regular license and CDL license reinstated. He refuses to get a truck driving job now. I’ve long suspected that he was on uppers but today was just the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. 

My daughter has ADHD and takes a medication called “Quillichew,” which is basically chewable Ritalin/Focalin. My ex-boyfriend called me this morning and told me that I owed him $20 because he got me a refill for my vape when he showed up to my house. I told him that he still owes me hundreds and I know for a fact that that those refill cartridges cost 9.99 at full price. So I told him that he can have it back if he’s going to charge me for everything and still expect me to dig him out of holes every month. So he basically told me that if I didn’t give him the $20 then he would show up at my house to take some pills out of my daughter’s medication bottle because “she don’t need them anyway,” and “I’m a little bit ADD anyway.” I lost it. I told him to get his own prescribed if he had it but I will never stoop so low as to steal my own child’s medication and he needed to get professional help if he really thinks that that’s okay. 

Well of course now he is upset and I haven’t answered his calls at all today. If he shows up to my parents house, he will have a terrible day. I’m not going to ask if I’m wrong because I know for a fact that I am not. But I realize why I ended up with him. He’s just like my mother. Just like my selfish ass greedy ass problematic mother. 

TLDR: my now ex-boyfriend broke up with me because I wouldn’t give him $20 when he already owes me more than $700 easily and told me to give him some of my daughter’s adhd medication or else he would show up to get it from me. Today made me realize that the reason I ended up with him is because he’s just like my selfish ass mother.",relationships
"Tl;dr : while visiting my home country, I [M, 19] hooked up with an old best friend [F, 19]. As we both talked multiple times, it was something casual, and decided to hook up with another friend that I wasn't so close to, but that knew another friend in common between all three of us. When friend in common found out, they all stopped talking to me. I guess my question is basically, was I wrong for hooking up with both of them?

Edit: had to repost to change terminology from another subreddit, so also decided to clarify: My best friend and the other girl never talk, I don't even know if they had their phone numbers before this happened. Also, even though the friend in common was the one to find out, in the end, I was the one to tell my best friend about it



Full story:

This has been haunting me for more than a year, and had nowhere else to go. Before we beggin I would just like to firstly appologize for any bad english, as its not my first language. Secondly, I am a male (19 at the time) and this story involves three other girls (also 19 at the time). Lets call them Brittany, Shirley, and Maria (a friend in common between me, Brittany, and Shirley)

As a background for everyone, I have been living outside the country I was born in, and now live in the US. Before moving, Brittany and I used to be best friends for years, but everyone around us would feel some tension between us (including ourselves). Shirley and I were ok friends, we would talk sometimes but we would mostly hung out because of Maria. Maria and I used to be great friends, and we would tell each other everything.

I would never try to hook up with Brittany, firstly because I didn't want to end the friendship, but also because I was just too shy. But in the beggining of last year, I had gone back to visit everyone for a few months, and we ended up hooking up. At first, I tought that was going to be it, but later I started to notice she was getting really attached, and started getting incredibly clingy.

As soon as I noticed, I told her we should meet in person, and while having lunch, I explained how I didn't think we should be going fowards, since things were getting too serious and I didn't want to fuck up the friendship, neither did I have the capacity to date her, since I was coming back to the US.

I was scared of how she was going to react considering how clingy she was, but she acted completly fine, said she tought the same thing, but tought that it wouldnt be a problem if we hooked up more. I agreed (my first regret). After agreeing, she started, herself, explaining how we should still hook up with other people, since it wasn't serious and all, and even showed how she was talking to guys on tinder, but also said she didn't want to know about my other hookups.

A few days passed, I tought about talking to her again about stopping, as she kept trying to meet with me everyday, even tough it was even stopping me from seeing family. She agreed again, and we kept hooking up. (My second regret)

Probably the same weekend, I met with Shirley, and hooked up with her next to a place where basically everyone we knew would go to. We didn't really care and all. Again, I was only expecting not more than a few hookups, and it seemed like she did also.

The day after, Maria texted me, knowing about my hookup with  Brittany, and asked if I did actually go out with Shirley. I tought someone had seen us, but I didnt mind, and just said yes. Wasn't trying to hide it, and I also trusted her. She then started saying that she was going to tell Brittany, and I explained the situation, that she doesn't care but also doesn't want to know about it, but she kept saying that if I didn't tell, she would.

I decided to tell her myself, as I tought it would just be too weird for her to know by someone else, and could probably hurt her. She seemed mad about it, but said that she doesnt care, that she is glad that I was the one to tell her, but she didn't need to know.

About two days later, I took Shirley to her house, because it was a weird time for a dangerous city, and I didn't want her to be walking alone. After we got to her place, she and I kissed once, said goodbye, she got inside, and I left.

The next day, I met with Brittany again, after she had just finished hanging out with a guy she met on tinder, and even introduced me to him. After talking for a bit, she looked at her phone, said she had to go to the bathroom, and another half an hour later came back, looking like she had just cried.

I asked what was wrong, and she said she had talked to Shirley and knew that I had kissed her the day before. I kinda panicked, and knowing she was too sad, lied and said nothing happened (probably the thing I regret most).

After a few days, I told Brittany that we should stop hooking up, and she never spoke to me again. I did also stop talking to both Shirley, and Maria.

I guess my question is basically, was I wrong for hooking up with both of them??

Edit: had to repost to change terminology from another subreddit, so also decided to clarify: Brittany and Shirley never talk, I don't even know if they had their phone numbers before this happened. Also, for the first hookup with shirley, I was the one to tell Brittany about it.

"We’ve been dating for a few months now and I haven’t had sex for about a year. Here’s the thing that happened with me. When I was young, I was sexually used by my mom’s closest friend/my babysitter. This happened for years and years and as I got older I understand what was going on more. When I was in my teens I started loving it and I had started voluntarily having sex with her since she wasn’t babysitting me anymore obviously. 

Then it ended when I was 17 and wanted to find a serious girlfriend. I was just feelings used because she made me think I was in love with her and then she made it clear she was just using me. Plus thinks just got wierd because she is much older and I felt bad for betraying my mom like that.

So I recentky had sex with my girlfriend and she had asked if I was a virgin and I told her I was. I know she would have asked me with who, what, when, where, so I thought it would be easy to just say she was my first. I also don’t really want to talk with anybody who I know about this to avoid drama and judgement.

Now I feel like a total jerk and I am feeling guikt because my girlfriend thinks we were each others’ first. What should I do now? Tell her the truth and apologize about lying?

TL;DR When I was younger I was being used sexual by my babysitter and things barely ended with her a year ago. My gifriend thinks we were each others’ firsts",relationships

My boyfriends porn history has left me confused and hurt

So, I found my boyfriend porn history recently (I know he watches it, we sometimes watch it together and I dont mind) 

BUT what bugged me was that he was specifically searching for BLONDE p.o.v  (usually its just pov) , now hes always told me he likes brunettes (which I am). I know its probably just me being stupid but its left me feeling like crap. I have it in my head now he wants something different and is bored of how I look. Now he watched several videos that day before “finishing” on someone who has bright pink hair lol so maybe im overreacting.

When I confronted him He told me he watches videos with best positions and doesnt really care too much about the face just watches the sex but why search blonde? He also used a stupid example of saying sometimes you drink diet coke even though its not as good as regular coke just so u can appreciate it better like what 


We have a great relationship  of 5 years and sex life and he always calls me beautiful, sexy etc but im just annoyed and needed some reassurance that im being stupid?

tl;dr : my boyfriend was searching up blonde porn when im brunette and im feeling insecure",relationships
"I broke up with my ex because we had arguments and communication problems that were addressed several times over a year and simply never got fixed and became worse and worse. We were sometimes in an LDR, too, and communication just frankly broke down. Lots of other insecurities of hers, too, were projected onto the relationship. So I ended it before we ended up fucking hating each other cause that was absolutely the path the relationship was leading to. She instantly agreed with me. We parted amicably and still maintain contact since we didn’t hate each other’s guts and are still friendly.

However, I feel like she contacts me now more than she ever did when we were dating. She hardly contacted me before during LDRs (one of the many catalysts for breakup), but now she sends me pictures, texts, etc. which somehow she never had ‘time’ to do during our relationship. What’s her deal?

TL,DR;

Broke up amicably with an ex where we had on-and-off LDRs. She instantly agreed with my decision. We had major communication and insecurity problems, and lots of arguments. But we broke up before we ended up hating each other. Consequently, we’re still friends. Now all of a sudden she sends me more texts and pictures than she ever did while we were dating or in LDRs. So she absolutely could’ve fixed the issues but didn’t. What’s her deal now?

TL,DR (2);

Amicably broke up with an ex. We’re still friendly. Somehow she contacts me more now than she ever did during our relationship where she’d practically ghost me? What’s her deal?",relationships
"Couple initial things-

1. This is my (30yo) very first Reddit post! This is my very first Reddit account! If I break any unspoken norms, sorry about that.
2. I chose my username based on Reddit's suggested names and honestly, who could resist RepulsivePermit7. A+, incredible.
3. I \*do not care\* if I am overreacting. I've thought a lot about it over the past month, and I've decided that my feelings are my feelings whether or not they're logical, and I'm writing this post to find out helpful/healthy ways to deal with them. Healthy coping methods? On Reddit? Is it possible?
4. This is so long! Sorry! I'll put the tldr at the top.

**TLDR;** I need coping mechanisms to put my emotions aside so I can make sure my mom doesn't die.

Growing up, I always really had the feeling that my mom loved the idea of me more than the actual me. She had a lot of fertility issues, and I was a miracle baby, and I think she spent that time planning what her kid would be like. Unfortunately she got me instead. There's a lot I'm not saying in this post about all the fun ways my natural personhood has disappointed her (I'm queer, atheist, I changed my first name, etc).

My mom is from a really insular religious community (no, not that one, but in the same family). I was raised in it, but around 14-15 I realized I didn't actually believe in any of it. I still really love the beauty of the traditions, and the culture that surrounds it, but the actual faith just isn't there. She found out I was researching specifically paganism, and lost her mind. I was already being homeschooled (not for religion, I just lived in a notoriously crappy school district), but after that, I didn't speak to anyone I didn't go to church (&lt;100 people) with for almost two years. My access to internet was highly controlled, and any extracurriculars (dance, piano, school classes outside the home) stopped (I think it was mostly money issues, but now I don't know).

All this time, I thought the reason she found out was because I had forgotten to clear my history or something and it was my fault for not being careful enough. Turns out it was because she had a keystroke logger, and she read.

Everything.

Every message to a friend (before I was on lockdown), every diary post, every google search, everything. She made a POINT to tell me she read all of it. She mentioned some things that make me believe it.

Here's the issue- Mom has cancer. She told me about the keystroke logger after almost two decades immediately after she was told. I know (I KNOW) she told me to try to push me away as a stress response, but like. Fuck, y'all. I ALSO had cancer in my past, so I know the deal of being a patient with a deadly disease. I had a stage III abnormal (read: liquid) Wilm's tumor and now I'm down a kidney and the top half of my femur. And maybe my appendix? Unclear.

The stress of the news, the fact that we have had the fight about her locking me away practically like clockwork multiple times a year and she NEVER told me about this, the huge violation I felt, I told her it would have been nice to have had a parent that trusted me (this is a word-for-word, exact sentence. It is the only thing I said. I have replayed it many times. I think I said it calmly but idk.) She told me the conversation was OVER and I needed to leave the room. I went into my old bedroom (now the guest/storage room) and just. Lost it. She tried to talk to me later, but I told her that I couldn't deal with her lack of respect for me right now. I'll admit, other things were said after that, but they aren't immediately relevant.

This was a month ago. I am trying really, really hard to be there for Mom. I'm her only kid and she's a widow, so I'm her primary in all of this. At the same time, I can't bear to talk to her. I honestly don't know if our relationship will ever be the same again. I had forgiven her for putting me in confinement, but now I'm dealing with those issues all over again. She said it was to protect my immortal soul or whatever. If you believe in that, that's cool. I don't, so I, as a personal opinion, see it as bordering on abuse. I told her I wasn't going to bring it up until after chemo, but we are NOT cool and we WILL be discussing it later. 

As many Americans know, yesterday was Mother's Day. We texted all afternoon about nice stuff, but I just couldn't bring myself to call her. I have been working really, really hard to put my current feelings in a bottle that I can open later, because right now my mother needs me. 

I know I'm failing to do that. Is there any recommendations out there for how I can just... idk, ignore my own self? I HAVE to deal with this in order to make sure my mom, you know, doesn't die. I love her a lot despite all this. I joke that we're Drift compatible. I'm LIVID, but I don't hate her.

Couple notes- we live in different states. With the thing that is happening, my husband and I have decided to not stay in her state in case we get trapped, so I'm splitting my time here and there, and doing looooots of driving to avoid other people. Also, she didn't apologize and said she'd do it again in a heartbeat, which honestly scared me and now I'm not comfortable leaving my electronics out of sight in her house.",relationships
"Hello,

First, I would like to say thank you, for your will and dedication to help.

My girlfriend and I have been together for two years.

She loves me, and I love her, she respects me, cares for my welfare, she does everything for me.

But, there are two issues, she does not have ambitions and world knowledge, thus our conversations' subjects are limited, at the beginning, she was not interested in studying, but she changed her mind only after I told her that it is important to me.

For me it seems that her dream is to get married and have kids, which I do not really consider it to be a dream, but a common desire.

My parents told me that she is a good woman, but they think that we are not really matched, meaning the absence of ambitions, dreams and world knowledge are big issues here.

I do not really know if it is related, but we also do not have similar hobbies.

If I decide to break up, will I be considered as a bad, selfish man?

I am really desperate, clueless of what to do.

Thanks for whoever read.

TL;DR: we have been together for 2 years, but my girlfriend absence of ambitions and world knowledge worry me.",relationships
"&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 5 and half years ago I started to isolate myself socially because of work, then because of BS drama people, I kept isolating myself and then one event triggered a huge depression. The pic of it lasted for at least 2 months and the depression continued for a year and a half more. The pic dropped down because I spent an after-party with an old crush and she was paying a lot of attention to me the whole time despite coming with her bf. Then a year later after that, I moved 1100km away partly for better work opportunities and better cost of living. I tried to start fresh and cut ties and communications with everybody. 4 years later I’m firstly thankful for that night that got me out of a spiral but also I started thinking again about my old crush and even though I’m not excepting anything as I live far away and why in the end would she still care to talk to me. But I know that if I can I’d like to have her back in my life in any kind of relationship because in retrospect she’s one of the only people I know who being around makes me feel good. But I’m afraid after that long that she wouldn’t especially want to reconnect and I don’t know what to even say…A “Hey, what’s up? Been a while eh ?” kind of text seems lame but writing a few lines trying to explain anything would feel kind of over the top too….Any idea of either an opening line and a general way of writing her?  

————————————————————————————————————————————————

I think I should start by saying, I’m not having big hopes or anything romantically planned. I just remember having so much fun and joking all the time with her and I was feeling genuinely good about myself just hanging out with her. And I 've been thinking about her regularly the past year or so and I think recontacting her would be actually the best because either we end up having some kind of friendly relationship or she just dismiss me and then I can move on completely. 

So about 4 years ago, I left my hometown and moved 1100km away in another country and it kind of just happened. I used to live in my family house with my dad, officially, but 5 weeks out of 6 I was actually by myself. Until he decided to sell the house. Then I had 6 months to find a new place in an expensive and over-saturated market which I gave up after 2 weeks of research and decided to look for a city that would be much cheaper and found a good alternative. Leaving everything behind wasn’t a huge deal actually due to the fact that I’ve been slowly isolating myself already for the past year and a half. I already left most of the social media a while back, except some account for business purposes and then when I moved, I changed my phone number and I didn’t transfer any of my previous contacts, apart from my family. 

In the beginning, I started isolating myself because of work. I was working with clients on weekends and was taking my days off in the middle of the week which had a huge impact on my social life, then some unrelated high school style drama kind of piled up and I was actually happy not to have to deal with a bunch of people that much anymore. 

And the few times I was actually going out with them I had just the worst time, and that really impacted me because I was happy to get a weekend off and go to a party or gathering and see some of my friends but then 3-4 of them were really, really annoying with remarks, being really judgemental and just a general buzzkill. And you couldn’t hide anywhere…Even when planning something without them, someone would just mention it to them anyway and kind of invite them and they would show up and make remarks that we’re not invited (I guess not taking a hint).

During that time I kinda got my heart broken or got some kind of mental breakdown (doesn’t really matter for the story) when at a “party” and in seconds I had to leave. I couldn’t stay. I just remembered that I really, really, needed to get away from there and I started sobbing uncontrollably in the streets (I was lucky they were basically empty) and from there for almost two months I was sad all the time. I would burst into tears in the shower and anything remotely emotional on tv or online would trigger tears. I stopped meeting friends, I was barely responding to texts. Despite that, I went to a friend’s play and after-party to keep appearances and because it really meant to him. And thank god I did. 

The play and his acting were pretty bad but he invited that girl, the one I had a crush on in the past and we always had pretty good chemistry in general (I think we would have ended up dating if the timing would have been right and mostly if I wasn’t an idiot …) I barely saw her for maybe a year or two because she started dating someone. Anyway, she came with her boyfriend and I was not super into hanging out with them at first because seeing her with him was already a bit painful and I was emotionally vulnerable too. 

But from the beginning, she was so happy to see me. 

For example, they passed right next to me, them in a car full of people, me on the sidewalk and she was yelling my name from the window and apparently went over her boyfriend in the car to open the window and yell my name and was overly excited to spot me as he mentioned to me later that evening. 

She was looking for me during the party all the time to take pictures, to go dance, we joked a lot and spent so much time laughing to the point it was making her boyfriend uncomfortable. He was overcompensating the attention deficit he was getting from her in really obvious ways (well he didn’t pee on her to show propriety but close). 

Anyway at that time I didn’t really know what to think, didn’t believe she was into me and frankly, I didn’t care why or what, I was just feeling better for the first time in months. 

Until that moment when I was sitting on the stairs in front of the building we just spent the after-party in and someone (girl) I knew was also sitting there. We started exchanging some small talk when suddenly my friend saw us and went in between us, sat down, faced me, completely ignoring the other girl I was kind of talking to and put her hand on my knee and just looked at me and start talking about how much fun we used to have when we met a few years ago and the things we did (we used to have games and jokes routine) until eventually her boyfriend arrived and was like “ok ok, babe come, we’re leaving, now” and had to repeat it twice. And there I realise my crush on her came back. Not super hard either but it was there which kinda was a lifeline, in the end, it kept me from being as depressed as I was before. 

Anyway, we kept in touch and did some bbq during that summer. I was still a huge mess and was still emotionally vulnerable (and will be for almost a year and a half more). We still had great chemistry but nothing happened. She was still with her boyfriend and I’m not the kind of guy either to pursue and go in between a couple, either they break up and I would have tried my luck in a heartbeat or if she made a move while with him, then that's on her and was her decision. 

Fast forward few months later and we were having dinner together with another friend and I announced them that I was moving away because of my dad selling the house and finding better opportunities in that big city and even though we weren’t hanging out or texting that much for already few months she seemed a bit upset and shy to comment compared to our friend who was most excited for me and already thinking to maybe visit me when I’m settled. Spoiler alert it didn’t happen. 

Few months after I moved, she followed me on Instagram (my business one as otherwise I closed my personal one for almost a year already), got the notifications in the middle of the night and with my Facebook account (for work) I check on her profile and find out she shared a couple of stuff I posted on my business page. I wrote to her and we briefly texted a few times but she was kind of distant. I even tried to invite her to come to visit with our other friend as it was mentioned at the dinner but she said she’ll mention to that friend and some other friends (the bunch of people I was trying to avoid for a while) but nothing happened because the high school drama ones were doing their BS as usual and they decided to go on a trip somewhere else instead of coming to visit me as it was initially proposed and then that trip got cancelled because of some more BS, which was a relief for the most part.

After that, she didn’t reply to my last text I left with an open question. Because I was away without any intention of coming back, I didn’t pursue again and she didn’t reply or write to me again. My crush on her faded away, also because so many new things were happening to me. I was meeting new people, I had new opportunities and a new lifestyle. After a while I thought that maybe the best is to completely start fresh and completely move on, I thought that it wasn’t healthy to keep having an eye on her from time to time unless I would actively go after her. I also had people I wasn’t looking to talk to, messaging me a lot on my social media which was mildly upsetting me because it was for work purposes and I had their BS pouring over those accounts so I closed them all as I didn’t really need them anyway. And that was the last kind of contact I had with my old life about 4 years ago. 

But like I said earlier, I’ve been thinking regularly about her, more than what I would deem healthy to be, despite some efforts to push away and change my train of thoughts every time she would come to my mind. I did at some point creep on her Fb profile very briefly just to find out she met and friended some of other BS people (but from the same group) which kind of stopped me trying to contact her again. But now I really want to move forward and either we become friends again or nothing but at least I know, I just don’t know what to say. Should I explain any behaviour in my initial text because just a “hey what’s up, been a while eh?” feels lame…plus knowing the BS people I’m pretty sure I got a bad rap. Any ideas what I should say and how to say it?",relationships
"

tl;dr it’s difficult to form new relationships as you age if you have social issues. Is it even possible?


So once you hit middle age, and you’ve been socially awkward your entire life but you realize as a human you have to form relationships for basic survivals and that charismatic people tend to have a higher quality of life even in areas not directly related to relationships...is there any hope for improvement? 

Not nearly enough people I can relate to when you’re single and male and have limited interests. I share virtually none of the interests of the isolated town I live in and I can’t relate to the culture at all (most people my age are in relationships with children) or the recreational pursuits of most of the people here. 

Living outside this town didn’t help much either. I became isolated in large cities and couldn’t find communities to join. 

It just seems I have nothing in common other than knowing there are others that have social issues. It doesn’t help I’m not physically attractive, not confident, no other markers of advanced social standing. The thought of a romantic relationship or having a family one day is laughable at best. 

I mean is there any hope for improvement at this stage? I can’t see any way to reinvent myself and I’m worried that even if I improve external factors such as appearance, my internal ones will cripple me regardless. It seems impossible to change my personality at this stage. 

The biggest lie our society believes is that age is just a number. It totally matters. I used to look young for my age in my early 30’s and I found the nature of relationships totally changed once my actual age was known even though nothing else changed. So there’s that as well...people only respect age if there’s evidence of accomplishment alongside (money, social status etc). Otherwise youth is far more attractive. And I’m quickly losing that. 

Realistically does there sound like any hope for improvement here? Or should I just accept it won’t get any different at this stage and then decide if I can continue to live with that reality?

"We briefly dated for a couple months last year and split it off due to slight communication issues and personalities (she'd bottle up her emotions while I'd be concerned at the lack of communication and talking). Afterwards though we stayed friends like we were before and continued to text everyday as friends. Big mistake since it didn't help me getting over her. It went on like that for months and I even confessed to her I still liked her twice, to which I was told she wasn't looking for a relationship and doesn't see me that way, but still wanted to be close friends. 

Afterwards, I told her I'd still be there, and even wished her a happy birthday. Then I just focused on school and stopped texting her for months. It was 7 months of no texting her. It became an easy habit over time and I stopped having feelings for her even though we didn't have any issues between us. I thought I'd gotten over her entirely with not texting everyday.

Last week I then got concerned and was wondering how she was doing through the pandemic, especially since we both live in the same town and it's mostly rural and barren low-income. She replied back immediately and we'd been talking again since. She seems way happier and less depressed than when we last talked as friends and healthier. But then I began to feel that same eagerness to talk to her everyday like we did before and reread messages and smile. I couldn't help it. At this point I think now those feelings returned but I feel it's entirely unfair to her since she may not feel the same way. I'm still not sure if we can even visit or hang out since the last time we hung out was last year given she still lives with her parents who are strict. 

At the same time, I don't want to break our friendship. She is enjoyable and fun to joke around with and we enjoy our conversations together. But at the same time, I feel myself growing back into a slowly obsessed slob who can't stop thinking about her. Not to mention being cooped up for months has made me feel rather a bit lonely. And I feel we're both different and changed people after not having talked to each other for a while. And things seem more mature and different. Any thoughts?

"I would have posted this in amitheasshole but they deleted my post because I mentioned she used to hit me before I moved out when I was 18.

My mum is a difficult person at the best of times.  She's got a horrible temper that can be triggered without warning and she will lash out over unpredictable things.  I currently only visit her once a year and she will be furious with me at least one time per visit.  She can't even be a reasonable person for that long to a daughter she hardly ever sees....

She finally got on Facebook about six years ago, which I initially was pleased with because now I can share pictures with her more easily.  However, some of my father's cousins started sending her content that was made by what she would call ""fake news"".  I have previously sent little ""corrections"" when she shared things like this. 

Last week she sent my husband a video that was particularly racist.  He showed it to me and I checked on Google - it's miscaptioned.  Anyway, here's our conversation:

&gt;Me: Hey mum. Please don't send videos like that to my husband, it's embarrassing. It's not even the congresswoman it claims to be. See here [redacted link]

&gt;Me: Please check your sources and don't believe things you see on Facebook.

&gt;Mum: [My name], this is your mother. I thought one of you would be interested in what these people are doing. I will unfriend him. Tell him it's not personal.

&gt;Mum: Do you really think this is the only thing these despicable people have done?

&gt;Me: If you unfriend anyone, it should be [dad's cousins] or whoever sent you this video.  It's highly misleading.  It was filmed in 1989 but it's supposed to scare us now?  And they've miscaptioned it as being from a current congresswoman so we're supposed to think she's going to turn everyone Muslim in the US.  It's just trying to make people hate that congresswoman for no reason.

&gt;Me: [Husband] says he doesn't mind if you send him videos, but I think you should try to find out whether or not the video is real before sending.

&gt;Me: Like [dad's cousins] should have done.

&gt;Mum: When did you lose respect for your parents? Who do you think you are speaking to? You do not need to worry about seeing anything from me. Full stop.

&gt;Me: Okay mum, well, I hope you have a good birthday and you can talk to me when you are ready :)

&gt;Mum: Don't talk to me like that.  That was disrespectful. Respect to me is more important.  Forget my birthday.

I am having a difficult time trying to put together a response.

I feel like I need to respond because she's done this all my life.  She's told me what to say and viciously retaliated if I didn't.  If she doesn't like something I say, she will hit me, or pull my hair, or give me the silent treatment for days. It happened last time I saw her actually, she didn't like something I said to my husband, and she let me know about it.

This has given me a lot of problems, throughout my life and professionally.  I don't feel like I can express opinions on things and when I try to do so verbally, it's very much a surface level, good/bad opinion.  My whole job is to give opinions.  I'm so grateful for email.

However, in meetings (and other groups of people) I stumble and stay quiet, and that's been remarked on a lot.  Hundreds of times.  

I'm not going to let her control me anymore and stay quiet, I need to stick up for myself now.  So do I say:

(1) Mum, you need to see a psychologist for your anger problems.  They are ruining your relationships. [OR]

(2) You can't control me like you did when I was a child.  I can, and will, speak to you how I wish, and if you are unhappy with that, we don't have to speak. [OR]

(3) If we are ever going to have a good relationship, you will have to let me talk to you as an adult.  I'm not your puppet or your echo chamber, I am a living human who has her own brain, thoughts and opinions. [OR]

(4) Birthday forgotten; return present and card.

I suppose another option is just to ignore the whole thing and never talk to her again.  I could block her on Facebook.  But I think my dad would be hurt and disappointed in me and I do love my supportive and sweet dad.

I'm a bit too close to the situation and I am fairly sure that no matter how I respond - other than grovelling submission - there will be an explosion that will flatten buildings in a ten mile radius.  So I could use some help.

"Two weeks ago I hung out with my best friend, his girlfriend (x) and a friend of hers (Y). 
This was the first time I met Y. A nice girl.

Yesterday I saw X again and she asked my how my relationship is going (which is unfortunately going downhill). Since I didn't feel like talking about it I just said that it was going fine.

Subsequently X told me that Y asked her what I think of her. And that she found it very cute.

Now I'm wondering why Y would be interested in that. Of course she must like me / find me interesting, right?

"I (19F) am currently a sophomore in college and I have been friends with this group (4 19F, 1 19M) since my freshman year. I spent almost all of my time with them when I was not studying, and I guess I sort of became dependent on them. During the beginning of my freshman year, one of the girls (19F) sort of treated me like trash and pretended I did not exist, and other people in the group noticed but did not say anything. But right after I confronted her (19F) about it, the entire group, within a couple months, sort of kicked me out and stopped hanging out with me and ignored me. I don't know what to do, since I sometimes see Instagram posts and it hurts and makes me sick to my stomach for some reason. I don't know why they have such a hold on me, and I have no idea what to do. I want to move on. I want to stop feeling bad about them not liking me, but I don't know how to. I keep telling myself that they were toxic and my other friends and family tell me that as well, but I don't know why it hurts when I see pictures of them together and commenting on each other posts and stuff.

The relationship has been such a rollercoaster for me, she says her past relationships have messed her up, and she is afraid to say it because she doesn't want to get hurt. She said she never meant to hurt me and she still cares about me but I just am struggling with the fact that she said she loved me for months without meaning it, she was able to lie to me every day of our relationship. After asking if I was someone that she thought she could love someday and her response was, ""will you break up with me if I said no"". She said that she doesn't even know what love is yet. How can I move forward with her, what are some things I can do.

"Hey all - 

Sorry for any mistakes or confusion, I'm a little fried from a draining morning of crying and ""fighting"". Any and all advice for this confusing situation is welcome, I'm kind of at a loss. 

I've (27F) been with my partner (30M) for about 2.5 years. When we started dating, I knew he was on the spectrum, had a family history of BPD and depression, and drank (he wasn't problematic when he did (other than the health implications). About a year ago we moved towns and moved in together, though I travel solo half the year (that is, until COVID). Since quarantine started things have been going downhill. He's in depressive moods more and more often, and I find myself unable to take them really personally and not respond with my own anxiety. I love him and I desperately want to help him in whatever way I can, but he's gotten to the point of just admitting he doesn't care enough to want to get better. 

He cares about me (i.e. has been tremendously supportive and sweet when I have work and family stress and genuinely is upset by my being hurt), but his knee jerk to me showing pain or dissatisfaction with things is ""well it's just a matter of time you realize I'm a POS and leave so I can't blame you."" Now, I've been with emotionally manipulative folks before that use that as a way of guilting you to stay and I genuinely don't think that's what he's doing. I think, in these depressive episodes, he really doesn't believe that he's worth sticking around for and it breaks my heart. 

But he's bailing on a lot of plans we have (day to day ones like our plan for today to go on a picnic and hang out (we both took the day off work)). We had a rough night last night and I got up this morning, assumed everything would be fine (like it normally is), and made breakfast. He came in and when I brought up ""hey wanna leave in an hour?"" his response was ""Oh, why do you still want to do that?"" This triggered a whole (admittedly somewhat rash) response from my end that ended up with us both crying, him saying he doesn't want anything (other than the die), and him just telling me that he makes my life worse and I should be spending my time doing some more worthwhile. 

I'm at a loss. I don't think he does. He's intelligent and funny and caring and so interesting and sweet. He melts my fucking heart, but this depressive downturn is killing me. It hurts so much to hear from the person you love that the only thing they want is to die. 

A few weeks back when we had a similar discussion he owned that he should be seeing a psychiatrist, but used the excuse that he doesn't even know where to begin. So I researched around town, found one that specializes with autism and BPD who is taking new (virtual) clients and takes his insurance and he's acting like I called his bluff. He now just says there's no reason for him to go see them because he doesn't really want to get better. 

I know I can't make him. It's on him to get help. But don't know how to reconcile how caring and sweet he is with how incredibly heavy his bad days are. I don't want to prove to him that he's not worth loving by leaving. 

TL;DR: Partner has severe struggles with BPD/depression and I'm at wit's end on how to help/not let it absolutely break my own heart in the process.",relationships
"I have a long history with my boyfriend. We were high school sweethearts, broke up, and then got back together 10 years later when we realized we both had wanted to be with the other this whole time. So when we finally decided to make it official again, things were amazing. 

The only problem is that we’re long distance. I’m a touch and quality time type person so it’s been really hard on me. I need phone calls, pictures, and FaceTime to feel close to him. He, on the other hand, has almost only done long distance relationships and is not only unphased by it, he doesn’t really know how to deal with a girlfriend being around a lot.

I have been working on tying up my life here so that we can live together. Even though our relationship is fairly new, we’ve known each other on and off for 10 years so we both agreed that this was what we wanted. But around the end of February something started to shift in our relationship and I’m starting to wonder if I should keep moving forward.

What happened was that he started to make more and more distance between us. First, it was anything sexual. He said he’s only interested if it’s in person. Then, it was FaceTime. He said he doesn’t really like it but he was doing it to make me happy. Then, the pictures stopped coming in. I can hardly remember what he looks like some days. Then, he withdrew his time. He said it was due to Covid, his team at work is understaffed so he’s working a lot. Now he’s withdrawn his words. He doesn’t text me good morning or good night, he won’t tell me about his day, he doesn’t call me sweet nicknames, and I can hardly get him to even say he loves me anymore.

I’m so hurt at this point over what our relationship has become, if it even is that. I called him one morning and told him that I felt it was ridiculous to pretend we were even dating anymore since we don’t even talk to each other and that I was thinking about ending it. He said that he didn’t want that and he knows I don’t either. He’s right. I want the old him, the one that was actually affectionate and gave me the time of day. 

I don’t feel I’ve changed, I’ve just backed off because I’ve been respecting his wishes. But now is his paradise basically a no contact girlfriend?? I don’t really know what to do here. Should I give it more time? Do I wait out the quarantine to see if it goes back to normal? Do I say we need a break? Or do I break it off completely? We used to talk about our future together and I’m scared to let go of someone that I truly want to be with.

TLDR; my boyfriend has slowly been pushing me away for unknown reasons and I’m not sure if I should give him the chance to come back or to break it off.",relationships
"TL;DR

My wife\[26\] and I\[30\] are experiencing some major communication issues. We've been having them for the better part of the last 12 months. Yesterday on Mother's Day, she told me a host of things she's not happy with in regards to our relationship and demanded change or get out. I need some quick information and skills to practice with her to not let this fail.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all. My wife and I just recently moved back to her home state into her mother's basement so we could pay off debts and get ourselves a home nearby so we're not so isolated by ourselves like we were living out in AZ. My wife has battled health issues for the past 2 years of my son being alive, so our 3 years of knowing each other has mostly been me knowing her as she is while sick. We've both had to go through an immense amount of self-development to survive being out in AZ on our own together. She's learned a lot about her illnesses and has kept herself alive, while I've had to change careers twice in order to keep making forward progress financially and have long-term growth to provide for her and my son.

I've not had a long history of deep relationships. The longest thing I had before her was 9 months and it ended when we hit our first big snag. She's been through several long relationships including a failed marriage from a high school not-so-sweetheart. Both of us have gone through a ton of childhood issues, and we believe I have BPD Traits, which mostly express themselves in the form of emotional regulation issues, and remembering what was said exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, we have gone through more stuff than most relationships survive, including having now moved back on our own (Wife did a lot of the packing so she could feel better about unpacking once we got a new house and I'm not the organizational guy. I moved stuff physically and helped where she asked or I saw), financial issues galore with not making enough to pay for most bills, having a kid for the first time and no one around to help, as well as health issues galore. I mean it's a miracle we're even still here and giving it a chance.

My wife gave me the ultimatum last night, though. She said I either need to change in the ways she's asking me to or gtfo and we'll never be together again, probably to also have issues with co-parenting because she's going to hate me thoroughly at that point. Regardless of all of that, I'm here wanting to know how I can better my communication skills. I get heated when she says things that include name-calling, portraying me as abusive or far worse than what I actually did (ex: I got upset that when I told her I'd like to go for a walk with my son while her and her niece(12 y/o) slept, she had attitude and claimed she already made plans to walk with the niece. I was upset because she never told me these plans and got mad at me as if I knew, or that I was going against our norm of asking the other person if they wanna go walk).

It's really rough. I feel like in order to continue this, I have to submit to her every desire and demand, because she's going to tell me to gtfo after all we've done to move out of our house in AZ to move here and have a less stressful life. I get really angry at her and sometimes cannot think clearly during arguments because she's said something so hurtful or untrue that I can't help but to defend myself, asking her to stop calling me abusive or playing up how awful what I did was.

I'm currently trying to give her what she wants because I want to be in my son's life and this is the last thing I can try before it's purely hopeless. If she can't be nice to me or appreciate me when I do everything she asks of me and don't fight back or defend myself, then I have nothing left to give. I'll just have to live with the fact that I'll have to be there for my son from afar and try to help him as much as I can without her taking advantage of me. (She thinks she's going to get everything we own, as well as a large portion of the $ I make, whether that puts me in a bad spot or not)

I want better communication between us so we can finally chill out and not be so unhealthy with one another. Any suggestions on the skills, books, videos on youtube, etc would be amazing.",relationships
"
My wife and I have been married for about two years now, and she is a master of disguise. When we first started dating, she was the sweetest person in the world, the type of unconditional love that made me think “man I gave to wife her up quick”. So I did, after 6 months of dating and 3 of being engaged, we were married. After the vacation, she got a new job paying way more than me, and it was off to the races. She would find a way to blame me for anything going wrong in her family life, work life, anything. Nothing was ever good enough for her, and in her head, she was the bread winner, so I handled all the “chores” , I had to have dinner ready for her every night, and if it wasn’t she would come down on me. Remind you she’s 5 foot 3, and I am 6 feet. But, truth be told, we are financially stable, have good sex, and my humor sometimes turns her frown upside down, so I’m happy here. Last week, I made a joke in my “brothers groupchat” saying that “I’m finally ready to divorce my wife” but it was joke from a previous conversation in person with them. The next day, it was like everything changed, dinners, quarantine dates after she got off, wanting to renew her vows, cooking FOR ME, calling me the best husband ever. It became obvious though,  when I started talking about a certain car that I feel is super luxurious (working class luxurious) that I wanted maybe if I got a raise, in which she responded “let’s see how my bonus looks, and you may can afford it” .  Now I’m not saying this is a terrible situation but I feel like she went through my phone and saw that text and now is trying to keep me around but why now? Or maybe she has just truly changed? Can people just change overnight? Has anyone else experienced this and how should I go about it?  

Tl;dr: My emotionless wife only seems to actually care about me when I threaten to divorce her",relationships
"I’m sorry if this sounds psycho or immature. I’ve been with my bf for about a year now. 

Now I’m not naive and I know there are plenty of attractive women out there. My bf has always been quite reassuring about finding me attractive etc (unless he’s really mad then he flips) so I haven’t worried too much. 

One time ages ago my bf was showing me a pic of one of his friends for something unrelated and said something like “she’s good looking isn’t she?”  I just agreed and didn’t think much of it. 

But today it just randomly occurred to me again because he hadn’t said anything like this about her other female friends. I asked him if anything had happened between them and he said it hadn’t but just that he thought she was attractive. He said he wasn’t attracted to her specifically but that she was attractive. I got insecure about him maybe liking her or thinking she was more attractive but he wasn’t really receptive to speaking to me about it. 

I thought it was a bit weird to say that he thought a specific mate of his was attractive, because of the connotations of it, and mentioned that. He then told me that he thought most girls he saw were attractive and didn’t seem to think it was a problem. Like that was a reassurance. He then mentioned another one of his friends and said she was attractive too. 

Semantics maybe so I explained to him what attractive meant, ie appealing sexually, and why it hurt that he thought this about most people. His response was that most girls aren’t ugly, he thinks most girls are attractive, etc. He got annoyed with the convo and said it was a waste of time so it kinda stopped. He was just saying “k” and “idc” and not really bothering to reply to me. 

I eventually explained I felt insecure and he said he was more attracted to me but it feels weird, like if you find 99% of the population attractive does it really mean anything? And I’m not sure if he was just saying that because I said it was weird for him to single out a particular friend. 

So am I being psycho? Part of me thinks I should just chill, while another big part of me can’t help but be bothered by the fact that my bf probs thinks bad stuff about MOST girls that he comes across. Like... most girls? Really? I guess I feel like that means he wants to or would bang like 99% of girls he encounters which is pretty weird to me. Thinking girls are attractive is one thing but most? Like is this all he thinks about?

But more so, I’m worried that he was just trying to deflect the fact that he has a longstanding crush on a friend of his and that he might be more into this particular friend than me. If he wasn’t why would he even mention how good looking he thought she was?

A bit of context that might help...

* Our relationship isn’t perfect. He has lied to me on a few occasions about his history with friends or colleagues (eg telling me he hadn’t slept with them and me finding out he has). That is in fact why I asked him about this girl in the first place. 

* Not to blame my insecurities on this but I had a really bad relationship a few years before this. My ex similarly used to tell me he found his girl friends attractive and that I was just insecure. He then turned out to be cheating on me the entire rs and trying to pursue these “friends” and was generally an ass. 

**tldr** Boyfriend told me he finds a specific female friend of his attractive. On discussion he suggested he found most girls that he encountered attractive. I feel kind of hurt by this but am not sure if I’m being psycho. I’m worried by the fact he might be into this particular friend more than me.",relationships
"Cheated on my girlfriend, what do I do now?

Hey Reddit, [22m] here, [23f] gf and I started seeing each other a few weeks ago and made it official last week. I slept with my ex - whom I dated for nearly 4 years - last night. I immediately regretted it, told my girlfriend first thing today and now I’m in limbo waiting to see what’s going to happen. I copped to everything, took full responsibility, and now I’m giving her the space she very obviously needs right now. I also cut all ties with my ex, regardless of what’s going to happen with my girlfriend.

I feel like an idiot. I’m falling hard for my girlfriend. I have no excuses. I got scared because of my leftover baggage from my last relationship and I hurt someone I really truly care about. I fucked up and I don’t know if I can make it right, or if it’s even fair to her to even try to; I don’t want to hurt her even further. I hope I didn’t ruin this blossoming new relationship. We’re pure chemistry and I’ll feel like a real jackass if that’s the case. So, people of reddit, what do I do now? All opinions are appreciated, even if you think I’m douchebag of the year.

TL;DR I cheated on my girlfriend very early on and don’t know what I should do now.",relationships
"(posted on a throwaway because he knows my account and I dont want him to see this)
My bf and I have been in an ldr for around 1.5 years and recently he has told me that he feels like I manipulate him. When he told me this I felt really guilty and tried to ask him what I am doing wrong, but he refuses to tell me and says I do nothing wrong and that I am the ""best girlfriend in the world"" and other things along those lines, but I think he would resent me for manipulating him. He avoids the topic and tells me we should talk about it when I am not on my period, when I am not feeling bad, etc etc, because ""thats how it should be"", but, as I said, I feel really guilty for making things seem as though I am being manipulative and I want to know what it is that I do which comes off in that way, because I really do love him and I dont want to hurt him. Additionally, now I feel as though anything I do can come across as being manipulative so I feel as though I must 'walk on eggshells'. I can't open up to him or tell him if something he does upsets me or something is going on in the family etc etc, things that we would normally have done, because I'm fairly sure that these things could all be interpreted as manipulative. I really want to sort this out because I really do love him so much and the thought of hurting him or him thinking that I am using him breaks my heart, but when I think of a way to phrase it all, I realise that it could seem manipulative because I would be talking abour myself and ""stealing the spotlight"" or trying to draw attention to myself.

The two of us have struggled and are somewhat struggling with some issues, and they've made many unwanted appearances throughout out relationship, creating fall outs and disagreements, but nothing we haven't been able to work out. Admittedly it is usually me who starts the grumbles, as I have a short temper and a pretty explosive personality which shocks even me when it happens, but he always remains very cool and calm and collected which I am pretty sure is the reason we are both still together and I am very thankful for. I can see how this can be seen as manipulative though, as I have heard that being explosive and short tempered is a sign of a manipulator, but when i brought this up to him, he denied it being something to worry about. I had tried to end muhsalf a few months back and I can't remember everything in full detail but I am fairly sure that when he knew and tried to call, I didn't pick up because I didn't want him to hear me throw up, so later on he thought I had faked the attempt. I don't really know what I am meant to say to it because it is my own fault and i was being really stupid, but it is still pretty upsetting to hear that he thought it. However, again, I can see how he would think that I am manipulating him if he thinks I faked the attempt. I have tried to explain things regarding thaaaaaat thing, but I know that what I did was not good and I don't really want to sit here insisting that I definitely did try to do it. Its hard to explain but it just feels wrong. Either way, anything I think of and ask about, he denies that it matters, and I don't know if he says it because he is scared of me or if he means it or whatttt.

I really need help. It seems as though if I try to explain how i am not manipulative, I would be trying to hide manipulation. If I try to say how something makes me feel regarding this situation, I am being manipulative because I am stealing the ""spotlight"", like I am begging for attention. If I dont find out what I am doing that makes him think this, I wont know what to stop so either i continue on as normal and he continues to feel as though he is being manipulated, or I stop doing everything and become Alexa :P

tldr my boyfriend thinks i am manipulating him. i am a bad person so its understandable. i cant see a way to stop him feeling this way because any way to go about it i think i will come off as manipulative anyway",relationships
"So Ive (18F) been dating this guy (23M), lets call him P, for 7 months and we've seen each other pretty consistently every weekend since we met. Initially, we met on a one-night stand, but we went for a proper date a week later, and after that we usually just hung out, got drinks, watched movies, and of course slept together. We never did proper dates like going to dinner, but that's not my thing so I never minded.

I fell for him HARD, and a few weeks after we met we talked about our feelings for each other. The conclusion was that I wanted him to be my boyfriend, but he'd just got out of a relationship two days before we'd met, and ""wasn't boyfriend material"". Because of this, and the big age difference, we broke things off (his choice not mine). But! then he missed his bus home so stayed over, and we continued to see each other without speaking of this.

We had an incident about a month after we met where he got lost when we were out drinking together, and couldn't get back to me (there's a whole long story about this involving some coke dealers and a strip club). I was upset and ended up sleeping with someone else, but he called before I fell asleep and we went back to mine. We were both angry at the other but he stayed at mine and slept for two days. Again, we continued to see each other after this.

I became friends with benefits with the other guy, and P knew this. I could tell it bothered him a little, but he never asked me to stop, so I didn't. The two guys even met each other once, and we almost had a threesome.

Three months ago, he drunk texted me and broke up with me, telling me never to speak to him again, and that he hoped I was happy with the other guy. The next day we called and he apologised, saying he didn't remember writing that, and that he understood if I wanted to end things. I forgave him, but the next weekend it happened again. After that we called and I said I had lost respect for him and wanted to stop seeing him. We talked for a few hours and I changed my mind and suggested we keep sleeping with each other as friends with benefits. We agreed to meet the next day to get coffee and talk. Alas, he cancelled as he forgot he had other plans.

Rather than reschedule, he called me late that weekend asking if he and a friend could come up to mine. Again, we ended up going out, sleeping together, and not speaking of becoming fwbs again.

I felt the near-break-up had brought us closer together. The relationship felt less casual and emotionally we were closer. I even went back to his twice. He lives with his parents so this was quite a big deal for me. He said that with his ex, bringing her back felt like a big step, but with me it felt natural. 

I stopped seeing the other guy at this point, as it felt wrong and I only wanted to sleep with P anyway.

I should mention that P is a coke addict. He only gets high on a Friday but it leaves him feeling terribly depressed and ashamed for a few days after. This happens every weekend. A big chunk of the times I saw him was when he was high, and we cuddled and slept together for his come down.

Coronavirus hit us two months ago, and I moved back to my parents for lockdown so we haven't seen each other since. However, we started calling each other every day. We spend hours on the phone every night, often going to sleep on the call. He's talked to my mother on the phone several times too, and they get along well. He told me he looks forwards to our calls, and that he'd be lost without them. A few times he told me he loved me, and I believed him. He really seemed to care about me, once telling me I ""had his firm loyalty"".

I was feeling really secure in our relationship, and despite the fact that we'd not talked about labels, I'd 100% consider him my boyfriend.

So here's where sh\*t kicks the fan. Last night, he mentioned that he thought a girl he matched with on Tinder looked famous. It was incredibly casually mentioned, but it upset me. I knew he got Tinder a few months ago but he said he doesn't actually meet the girls, and he didn't even know why he had it, so it wasn't really a big deal to me. I thought it was just an ego boost, or a boredom thing, so I brought it up with the intention of asking him to delete it.

When confronted, he said he thought we were both seeing other people. He noted that I was sleeping with someone else a while ago too. He described us as ""just friends"", and seemed confused that I thought otherwise. The comment about me having his loyalty supposedly meant that he has my back, like friends. 

Let me tell you, I was *devastated.* Its only been a few hours, but now I'm just really *confused*. How could he think we are just friends when we are clearly so much more than that? He cant think we are fwbs like I suggested 3 months ago, considering at the moment we are literally the opposite - no sex, just emotions.

I'm not sure if he's been sleeping with, or dating other girls in real life. We agreed to not talk for a week to give each other space to think, so ill ask him then.

The only explanation I can think of is that he just wants a very casual relationship to have me around for the convenience. Perhaps he cares about me, but now I feel like I'm just someone to suck him off when he's on a come-down, and now to stop him getting lonely in lockdown.

If you've managed to read all of this, thank you, and also: what the hell is going on with my relationship??? 

If anyone could give me advice for what to say to him next week that would be very much appreciated. I'm clearly not great at communication but id really like to know where we are both at, and if we continue to see each other what the boundaries are. I just don't know how to say this to him and ensure we are both on the same page.

Id also like advice on if I should, or whether its possible to start a proper relationship from this point, in the event that he just wasn't aware that I had such strong feelings for him. If you think I'm a fool for considering staying with him, please say, as that's the kind of wake up call I need.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

I've been consistently seeing a guy for 7 months but he's now saying we are just friends. We have sex, he tells me he loves me, and we've been talking everyday for the 2 months of lockdown. 

Im really confused.",relationships
"My girlfriend and I have known each other for a little more than a year but we have been dating for a little more than 3 months. We were best friends for a long time, so we have very good communication. We have healthy conversations, are open with one another, and are honest about things. We can disagree and not start to point fingers at one another; in fact, when one of us is sad or upset, the other immediately takes responsibility and tries to see what they can do better.

Our biggest obstacle so far is the current global situation with being unable to see each other. Her parents aren't letting her leave the house and thus seeing me in person is off the table. I should also note that my libido is very high, as it always has been. However, before the situation we were able to make out or engage in other sexual acts together when we would meet up in person. Because of this, masturbation was the only option these past few weeks for me to relieve the frustration I was feeling. She soon discovered that she also was getting a little frustrated in that sense, and so we started masturbating together through FaceTime.

She imposes a very regulated schedule on herself though, meaning she can't always indulge my urges when I have them. Also, despite her schedule, she sleeps in pretty late some days while I have had to wake up early for classes. This leaves me the whole morning (where I typically have urges the most) to bide my time and wait. At first, I used some pictures (non-explicit) I have of her in order to get off, but I found that it was hard imagining doing things when looking at them. I obviously think she's an extremely attractive person and I also love her very much for just more than her body and appearance, but I was finding it difficult to imagine everything every time I got off without her.

We have had a discussion about porn before where we agreed that I wasn't going to look at it anymore because she felt uncomfortable about it. I've also slipped up once before and masturbated to porn, and confessed to her with a lot of guilt. She forgave me, said that she was happy I could be honest with her, and said that she hopes I don't do again.

I gave in to my urges, however. I have been masturbating while looking at porn a lot recently, even when she is available to do things on FaceTime. I have gotten to the point where I've lied to her a few times saying that I was exercising or showering when, in fact, I was masturbating to porn. I lied because I felt ashamed and guilty for what I was doing, and I still feel guilt now. I definitely understand that I should not be letting masturbation interfere with us to the point that it leads me to lie to her to buy me more time, and I'm going to stop doing that. I just don't know if it really is wrong for me to continue doing this, whether or not I should tell her, and if I should, how I should do it.

I see a long future with her ahead, and I really don't want my mistake and my inability to resist my urges to destroy everything we could have.

Tl;dr: I jerk off to porn despite telling my girlfriend I wouldn't. I've lied to her about doing something else while actually looking at porn. What should I do?",relationships
"My boyfriend (39m) and I (27f) have been together for two years. He’s been married and divorced twice in the past. He’s a good guy and he treats me very well. We share the same values and morals, we’ve talked about children in the future and agree on how we’d raise them, he’s very hard working and smart. We don’t have that much in common when it comes to hobbies, but I’ve looked past that because I think it’s good that we have our own hobbies. But I’ve been having doubts about our relationship because he told me a while ago that he doesn’t want to get married again and he can’t love anyone aside from his family. I was ok with not getting married, but I don’t know if I can have a future with someone who doesn’t love me. The most he’s said to me is “I enjoy your company.” He wants to have children with me because he thinks I’m pretty great and says he can’t imagine raising children with anyone else, but I’m not sure if I can have a future with someone who just enjoys my company. I don’t know what to do and I really need some advice!

"This happened sometime back, I have this best friend (24M), a Gemini if I must add, whom I see as a big brother. He knows my likes and dislikes, is aware of my emotions and cares for me. We went on overseas trips tgt and we text every once in awhile. You could say that we were pretty close. 

We have this Mutual friend whom I disowned as a friend because she backstabbed me. She had said that I was trying to snatch him away (because she was interested in him). She’s also a hypocrite because she in person she treats ppl nicely but behind she tends to make rather negative remarks at times. However she is really expressive with her love for others, so she will always write cards/letters and tell ppl how much they meant to her. That was also how I thought she was a good friend until I found out she backstabbed me 

She is very very pretty. And obviously knowing that I cut her off as a friend, my guy best friend was on my side and didn’t hang out w her as well. One day, she reached out to him and they started talking, and they got together eventually. 

It was so hard for me to take this in and I told him we cannot be friends if he’s together with her. Of course he didn’t understand why. We haven’t talked for a year. These days I’ve been missing the friendship more than ever and I felt like it was such a waste. But at the same time I’m really upset and disappointed because it felt like he obviously prioritised her more than me and just shows how insignificant I am to him??? And it’s appalling because he knows that she is manipulative and has backstabbed me yet he chose to be with her. 

What I want to know is, should I have just stayed friends with him despite all this? Or can anyone give me any advice on how to feel like I’m significant and  am a worthy friend?

Male best friend (24M) got together with a mutual friend (23F) who backstabbed me previously. Does that mean I am not worthy enough as a friend?",relationships
"So I’m 5’3 127 pounds. I’m not overweight but there’s definitely fat in my tummy, butt, etc. My ex just broke up with me after 3 years saying he wasn’t attracted to me anymore. I always knew I wasn’t his type. He liked really supermodel-ish girls that looked really fit and athletic and were flashy. Like Instagram models. I’ve never been that type of girl. I know I’m not ugly, I know my face is more attractive than his. I have a lot of people telling me that they thought I was out of his league looks wise but every time I was with his I was kind of ashamed of myself. I have anxiety and body image issues. I always tell myself I’m good the way I am to build self confidence (another thing I lack) but it’s so hard when you know the person you respect the most doesn’t like a part of you that you’ve had issues with for a long time. He told me he liked girls with confidence but then tells me shit like this like it won’t hurt my self esteem. He told me he would wake up and look at me wanting more. That I wasn’t enough. And I’m so broken. I think I need therapy but I lost a lot of trust. 

I thought we were happy. He never brought it up except for a joking manner and all of a sudden he just dumps me and refuses to give it another shot. Something similar happened last year. I lost 10 pounds because I was so stressed with how he saw me but regained 7 pounds in 6 months bc of school and stuff. That and because I thought he was satisfied. But apparently not lol. He works out too but he isn’t jacked or even on the impressive side. I’m not all about that fitness life and honestly don’t find working out that enjoyable. guess he wanted someone to show off and I wasn’t enough. I heard all his friends support his decision and it’s understandable. 

I guess the point of this post was to ask... am I crazy that I’m acting like this? Do I deserve to be stranded and confused like this? Before quarantine we were living together and he told me he loved me and wanted a life together. I just felt I was led on with empty promises. He is a good guy I swear and I know he still cares about me but is this really a deal breaker? Do most guys think this way? This is both of our first relationships so does anyone have any advice on how to move on and even work on my body image issues? I wanna actually start being fit but I don’t want to think of him anymore any time I work out. He said we could call tomorrow to have closure so I guess that’s why I turned to reddit. 

TLDR: Ex broke up with me because i wasn’t fit/too chubby in his eyes and now I’m broken and hurt. Am I crazy? Tips on how to move on and fix my self confidence pls.",relationships

I don’t consent to this being posted anywhere else. 


We got in a relationship about 6 months ago and it was going fine expect for these two problems: he zoned out when I’m talking to him and he mostly talks about himself

So this behavior happened a few times on the past but I didn’t really pay attention since we would only go out on dates and hang out for maybe one day and not more. The dates were usually pretty frequent but it wasn’t for why I consider an extended period of time. 

This has become more apparent to me since miss rona has come about. We are both in quarantine and live alone so I usually spend a week at his house then he spends a week at mine but to be clear we haven’t seen anyone else.  At. All. 

So I noticed this behavior the first week I spent the night. We were watching a movie and he was trying to fix something on his phone and was getting frustrated and a little short with me which I understand, but when I asked him a simple question he ignored me. I asked the same thing 3 more times he ignored me again until I went to bed. We made up in the morning and he apologized for not paying attention for literally the 10 seconds it would’ve took to answer my question. I let it go, no harm no foul. 

However over the weeks it’s happened more and more where I’ll be talking about something or we’ll be mid discussion about a show we’re watching and he’ll just stop listening to me so I trail off and stop talking because I realize he’s not listening. Or he’ll cut me off and say something over me. So I’ve started talking less and less to the point where I usually only talk when he’s addressing me first because I don’t enjoy talking to the air. 

He’s also really into himself. He’s into music and to be perfectly honest he’s about as good as a SoundCloud rapper (no offense). But he enjoys it so I let him do as he pleases. The problem is that he constantly thinks he’s the next Drake and talks about himself that way. Like he’s a superior being or something like that. And it’s constant. Jesus it’s freaking all the time. His album is always dope and his sound is always “different” (again it’s not but he’s happy doing it so whatever floats his boat). 

I guess my question is; are these things we can communicate through? I’ve asked him to stop interrupting me and he’s gotten better at that but I’m genuinely reluctant to go to his house because I know I’ll be half listened to. Should I cut my loses now or talk through it with him?

TL;DR: I’ve talked to my bf less and less because he either doesn’t listen or interrupts me and only talks about himself.",relationships
"So back in September 2019 I found out my wife was having online relations with other people. I had already assumed she was cheeting because all her manurisms had changed for a couple months prior and so I told her if she needed something else in her sexual life that I will be open-minded to new things as long as she is honest with me about what she's doing and with who. She just said ok, and kinda laughed. Then a month later she gets a txt at 1am so I looked at her messages (I knew it was not right but I snooped anyways) it's some guy txting her about meeting up for sex later that week.

I confronted her and we had many a discussion and argument over the next few days and in the end she tells me she has been depressed and she is sorry she hurt me but if I can help her.

She is my best friend so of course I agree and having delt with depression in my life I am completely understanding. 

Fast forward to now, it's been over 6 months and she has done nothing to work on solving her depression. I don't think she was lying about being depressed because she is the kind of person who will avoid her problems for as long as she can. But when I ask her about working on her depression she says everyone just wants money and no one will really help her. When I suggest things like lifestyle changes or exercise she say yah maybe then never does anything to change.

I don't know how to be motivating anymore so I stopped trying to be a happiness coach and now I do my best to just be supportive. I clean the house and her dirty dishes when she's too depressed (most days) I do nice things for her to show her I care like telling her she is special to me and beautiful inside and out and take her on romantic dates. 


TL;DR:
I feel like I'm losing motivation to help her through her depression when she does nothing to help herself and now I'm fighting the the feeling that Im not in love with who she has become.  I don't want to give up on her, I do love her I'm just not IN love anymore.

"My husband is an only child and I just have the one sister. With all of this coronavirus hoopla I thought it would be best to try to square away our will. My dad passed away and it's just my mom. My husband's parents are a bit older and not in the best of health to care for a child.

I've gotten closer to my sister in the past few years as growing up we were too far apart in age.

I thought she would be the perfect candidate for a guardian as she seems to adore my son and my husband gets along with her as well. We have life insurance and had plans for the rest of our assets.

When we asked her to be the guardian we told her that the only caveat would be if we are ok with her future husband. (I would tell her first and foremost if I thought he was abusive or not good for her, this wasn't about if we could all go vacationing or something). She was immediately ecstatic and said yes, and we were glad.

She called a few days ago stating that she wasn't ready for a commitment and she wouldn't be comfortable being a guardian until she was more settled. I said thanks for letting me know and said I had to get off the phone.

I'm pretty bummed. Had the roles been reversed my husband and I would have gladly said yes. If I had any fears / reservations I am confident that I would have asked questions and would have done whatever I could to take in her hypothetical kids. I've always looked out for her and tried to help when I can when it comes to education, career, etc. 

While I'm glad she told me before any legal paperwork got started, I'm really sad that my son wouldn't necessarily stay within the family. I'm just really sad and disappointed and this definitely makes me feel different about my sister.

Am I justified in feeling this way, and how do I make sure this doesn't affect mine (and even my husband's) relationship with her moving forward?

TL;DR sister said she doesn't want to be my son's guardian in the event of mine and my husband's death. This makes me feel very sad and disappointed.",relationships
"Okay so before I start, we’ve been together 2 years, lived together 1 1/2, super happy, all that jazz.

Well, I’m a highly emotional person, but I’m not great at dealing with people who aren’t extremely communicative about their own emotions.

If something is wrong with me, I can tell you down to the last detail what’s wrong, why it’s wrong, etc.

When he gets stressed, he’s just stressed. He says that’s it. He’ll say “it’s going to be a busy weekend and I’m unhappy about it” and then things will be great, perfect, etc. then I talk for one second too long or show him one too many memes and he suddenly wants to be left alone and doesn’t want to talk. So then I give him space but he wants me to cuddle with him, or he’s sad that I’m not with him.

I feel awful because we’ve argued about it twice this weekend and I just feel so terrible. He keeps saying there’s nothing I can do to help, but I’m not trying to help, I’m trying to understand.

I get some men have a hard time with letting out their emotions, but when they do, they’re so contradictory and confusing that there’s no way to even begin to understand. So I’m trying to understand, but apparently that’s overwhelming, too.

He doesn’t want space, either, but I feel like I’m constantly unsure of what to do or say. It’s not often that this happens but when it does (this time, because his boat is about to cost him $1k in damages) I feel like my head is floating, like I just have no idea what I’m supposed to do to be a good girlfriend and support his emotions. How do you support emotions from someone who only has them when you least expect them?

I exist, too, and I get that relationships are give and take, but I’ve got no idea when to give or take. It happens so fast that I get mental whiplash. Doesn’t help that I’m PMSing, either.

"This is like, my first reddit post so I hope it doesn’t get too waffly. We are both first timers in terms of relationships.

So it’s been 1 month since I’ve been going out with my current girlfriend. I love her very much, and with most countries on lockdown cause of COVID-19, I communicate with her via video calling. The first month of us going out we were talking a lot, always laughing (despite my unfunny corny jokes), and overall having positive vibes with each other. I’ve got to known her very well despite a month and video calling her was basically always exciting.

Things started to change entering this month as I’ve noticed a few things while calling her. She seemed to smile less and laugh less, and I was kind of concerned as she suddenly became like this. I asked her if anything was wrong but she would just say oh no it’s nothing and brush it off. That was until today, we got in a video call and she seemed very sad. I’ve never seen her like this and was just very genuinely worried. That’s where things went south.

Before getting into a relationship with my girlfriend, I actually liked another person and was thinking of asking her out at some point. However when I met my current girlfriend for the first time, those feelings started to fade away. Because of the COVID-19 situation, I had to say bye to my current girlfriend (who I wasn’t with at the time) and flew back to my home country. She decided to stay in the country where we met. It was on the train on the way to London that I knew I should’ve asked my girlfriend out first and suddenly my feelings for that other girl was gone.

Back into the video call I had most recently, I asked her what was wrong and she told me about the fact that she was wondering if I would have asked the other girl out. I answered no as my feelings faded away for that girl as soon as I realized I liked my girlfriend very much (keep in mind I’ve told her this a few days into our relationship as I felt like I was obliged to be honest). She said alright and seemed like she understood but then told me she didn’t want to talk to me and hung up the call. I told her that I was sorry if I caused stress or if she was feeling upset about this.

I’m now stuck here in my bed 10000 miles away from where she is, wondering whether this is my fault and that I’m the asshole who is making her sad, or if she is just overthinking the situation. She straight up told me she doesn’t want to talk to me, so I have no clue when to talk to her again to clear things up or to try and generate conversation. She still texted me good night like always however.

Again this is my first relationship, and I am super confused, upset, and regretful that I made here feel this way. I’d really appreciate it if someone could help me here.

TL;DR girlfriend now does not want to talk to me because she feels that I wasn’t being loyal by liking someone else before being with her (but pleas read the whole thing to understand my situation better)",relationships
"Reposting after like 5 minutes of it being up to edit the title and add a bit more context to be more clear - I'm sorry, this is my first time using reddit, I'll make sure to add edits to the post itself from now on.

Hi everyone, this is my first ever post on reddit. I’m just at a loss at this point and don’t know what to do. I’m sorry that this is long. TLDR at the bottom

Some background: I had a very tough relationship with my mom growing up as she was mentally, and at times, physically abusive. She was controlling and a master gaslighter. My dad supported everything she did and was never really there emotionally. I truly believe that my mom never liked me, let alone loved me. She made it clear that she saw me as a failure every step of the way. She passed away before I graduated university but I’m sure she would’ve made that about how I’m a disappointment as well.

I’ve had some close friends growing up and over the past few years, but it seems like we always end up having a falling out a few years in. I know this is partly my fault, I can be a lot at times and I used to be (I’ve been working on it) stubborn to a fault. But at the moment I have no friends and I just feel very alone. I have always had a hard time making them, and now that I’m out of school it’s even harder.

This doesn't fully relate to the main issue, but it does add to the major insecurity that I can't get out of my head right now. I am terrified that I'll go through life without ever truly fully being liked or loved as a person.

Now here is my main issue: I’ve been with my boyfriend for nearly two years and he says he loves me. We’ve had some pretty bad fights, he pushes people away whenever things get bad at all. It generally starts with me telling him how I feel and him shutting down or pushing me away. He’s been working on this as he know it hurts me, and has gotten better. A few months ago, this cycle happened, I told him my feelings in a calm and rational manner and he shut down. I pushed him for validation or just something from him, and after a while I guess I pushed too hard. He said some really mean stuff that really hurt. Specifically what I can’t get out of my head is that he said “I don’t even like you”. I asked him to clarify as I was hoping I misunderstood and he said “Honestly, after thinking really hard, there isn’t one part of you that I like that isn’t just surface level shit.”. After this I left the room and stayed in the spare bedroom for a few days. I honestly thought this was the end. But we somehow got back to normal. I can’t get this out of my head though. He said he didn’t mean it, but I’ve told him before how one of my biggest insecurities is that I’m unlikeable/unlovable. I’m really just not a likeable person. I don’t fully know why but I’m not, but it's sort of always been that way. I've tried to change myself many times but I just don't know what's wrong with me. And he's always reassured me that he likes me and loves me and he doesn't understand why other people don't/haven't.

Since then, he has done a lot to better himself and show that he’s there for me and tries not to shut down and push me away. He has shown that he regrets what he said, and he has been actively trying to show me that he loves me and wants to spend his life with me. But I just feel like I’ve never been truly loved. As much as I want this to work, and I see that he does too, and he’s really trying, I hate feeling this way. **If I continue feeling this way and stay with him will I go through life believing that I’ll never truly be loved?** I don’t know what to do. I’m sorry if this is all over the place. I was in therapy but cancelled my last appointment because I’m scared to bring this up. I'm scared I'll just break down and I don't know how to handle it. and I’m scared to talk to my boyfriend about it for two reasons: 1. I’m scared he’ll shut down or say “well if you’re feeling this way we should break up”, and 2. I don’t think he could help me feel better and then it’ll just be me making him feel bad. I know he loves me, and I love him. I imagined a life with him. He was my person. But now I just feel so lost and hurt and I don't know what to do.

"Not sure where to put this since it’s not a relationship but they are friends. 

I (26m) have a firm start date next month in another city. The plan was to live with these guys (23m) who all work for the same company (I don’t work with them). 2 of them just graduated from college and were planning to start their jobs next month too. However last week they were notified that their start dates have been pushed back to August. They do not get any moving allowance money until the first paycheck. 

They are still considering moving options starting in June/July they do not have to have the place in June however I need to be there in June. I’ve considered doing an Airbnb or living with a family friend for a few weeks until July. 

However my concern now is that since two of the guys job start date was pushed back by 2 months. Personally if I was them I would be looking for another job since that is a very bad sign in my opinion. How do we know they will need those guys in August? 

I contacted another friend who turns out he needs a place in June. They already work and live in the city. He and his roommate are already in negotiations for a 2 bed place(they seem motivated to get a place ASAP). I ask to join them and he said we could open up the apartment search to a 3rd bed room. If I go down this road then I have to stick with them regardless of what happens. So I’m concerned about how to navigate through my problem and handle all of these friendships without making people mad. 

Tl;dr 

Planned to live with these 3 guys. Initially we all had job start dates in June. 2 of them had their start date pushed back to August. They are willing to rent a place starting in June/July. My concern is that their jobs are being pushed back. I contacted another friend who is in negotiations for a 2 bed place (needs a place in June too). They are willing to break it so we can look for a 3rd bed. Trying to decide who to run with. If I roll with new guys then I have to stick with them regardless. If I stay with the guys who don’t need start until August then there’s a possibility that they don’t have jobs (IMO). How do I handle this problem without making people mad?",relationships
"We were once very loosely committed fwb, ending it was fine, but we've talked for 2ish years afterwards. Over time it grew into a pretty close friendship, eventually getting to shared interests and outlooks on life. I think we both also realized we weren't cut out to be in a serious relationship with each other, but that was never stated.

Recently she's started telling me about every guy that's into her or how great her hookups have been. And most frustratingly how she's down to ignore quarantine restrictions to hang out with bros.

I don't share the same info with her as it seems kinda rude. I like her as a friend, I'd be sad to lose that, but it's feeling worse and worse dealing with what feels like weird jealousy games. At the same time I don't want to be a jerk and just ignore her; is this just what she talks to any close friend about? As we've gotten closer, does she now feel like we're tight enough I can be trusted with her very personal life?

We do have a lot of up and downs there have been times were he said he was done with us or to not speak to him with no explanation but then text me again a couple days later like nothing happened. Which leaves me feeling confused about where we stand. I told him that I do want to be in a relationship and when I asked him what his intentions were he said to see me and talk to me. Then I asked him if he ever saw us turning into something more in the future and he said he didn’t know because I was asking him something so far in the future and that wasn’t a fair question because he didn’t even know what he was going to do today. However, I feel like by now he should know if he wants to be with me seriously or not. I told him I needed space and I did end up texting him again and he said it didn’t make sense me going back on my word when he does the same thing to me but even worse when he tells me he is done. I’m trying to move on and let go because I know this is toxic but it’s difficult and idk how.

"Bare with me here, my brain is a bit messy with the situation. I can't get a decent perspective on it. 

On one hand, I have never had a healthy relationship so I keep thinking that what my bf does are red flags. 

On the other, I keep thinking maybe I'm bad and I'm imaging things because I don't know what's good in a relationship. 

Some of what I assume to be red flags: 

- he constantly makes fun of my relationship with my cat, keeps saying things that I hear as ""you're not very smart for loving your pet so much"". Plus, whenever I get upset because he went too far, he will joke that he needs to remember that my pet is a red line. I feel like I have a healthy relationship with my pet, I take care of her and I do what I want with my life.

- whenever we have something to work out in our relationship, he makes a plan to fix it, and even though I might not like it, I give it a try. Only for him to revert to old behavior while claiming that it wasn't the case, that I agreed to the plan change all along. I honestly sometimes think that he must have a severe memory problem. 

- he has a bit of an ""only child"" behavior. Only his plans are good enough, whenever I suggest something and even though he does not say a word to me about it, his level of engagement is very low. While he's giddy as a small child with a new toy whenever we do something he wants. To the point where I feel embarrassed of his public behavior. 

- he has to question everything I say if it doesn't fit with his perspective. Which is completely fine, until he starts arguing about whether my family has a speech embedment issues or not. This will fit into everything, I tell him about something personal and he will have to argue its validity because it simply doesn't fit his perspective. 
 
- with this quarantine, he's essential and I'm not and my sleep schedule has been a bit off. He made me feel so bad about it. Then he messed up his schedule a bit with fasting (he's a muslim, I was raised as one as well but don't keep strict) then his schedule ""couldn't be any better"". I hung up after saying that I need to go without waiting for his respond and he called me disrespect, I tried to explain and he insisted that he did nothing wrong. Which to a degree he didn't, I didn't tell him to back off whenever he made me feel bad about my sleep schedule. 

Honestly, after that, I was just put off severely. Its been 8+ days that I really haven't been talking to him. It took him about 5 days to start messaging me daily with memes and stuff to try and engage me but I can't. I feel sick about it. 

I keep thinking maybe my perspective is warped but I'm clueless to how I can fix that. And if my perspective isn't, then I don't know. I really don't feel like breaking up with him.

Can someone please give me a perspective that might help me sort out this mess in my head? 


TL:DR; I cannot tell if I'm in a toxic relationship or not, need a new perspective to help me think.",relationships
"
When I met my boyfriend two and a half years ago he was very upfront about the fact that he had a nicotine addiction. It didn’t really bother me since he uses a vape and doesn’t smoke cigarettes. He told me that he wanted to quit because it’s an expensive addiction and the other obvious health reasons. I fully support him doing this and try to be as helpful as possible but I have no experience in terms of substance addiction so I did the best I could. 

He’s been up and down with it over the years. A year ago he was down to 0% nicotine but just using the vape to occupy the oral fixation. I found juice with nicotine a week later on his desk that he confirmed was him getting back on because he doesn’t feel anything with the zero percent and it was hard. I was admittedly a little harsh at first because I had found the bottle and he didn’t talk to me about it at all. I was hurt he would keep this from me. But I understand it must be hard to kick an addiction like that. 

In January we went on a trip to Disney with my family where there is a strict no smoking/vaping policy. He said he was going to use the trip to motivate him to limit his use and it worked really great. By March he had hit 0% juice again which was really big and I was excited for him. 

This past weekend he confessed to me that for the past three weeks he’s been back on nicotine because his job has really been stressing him out. He’s been working from home and his company furloughed a couple people so he has been taking on their work which he has never been trained on (he’s been working there less than a year). At first he just said he had used some disposable vapes that had about 5% nicotine and then he confessed that the first week he told himself he would just do it once so to limit himself he bought a pack of cigarettes. He smoked the whole box and then bought the vapes after. 

I was disappointed but mostly concerned. He was really ashamed and cried a lot when we discussed it. He had never really let me in on how hard this was for him. I was frustrated with myself for not picking up that he wasn’t really letting me know how it’s been affecting him and being more supportive. I have never helped someone through fighting addiction before. I just want to know what I should be doing to help him and also keep him on track this time around. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TLDR; I need advice on how to help my boyfriend fight his nicotine addiction. I just want to be supportive and helpful.",relationships
"This might end up being quite long and I apologize for that. Yesterday my mom said “i didnt think you would end up with a guy like Sam” and it just really made me think.

Sam is a wonderful guy. We’ve been together for about 8ish years now, since college but broke up for a year during it because of long distance (he studied abroad in college twice and it proved to be too hard for me the second time around, plus he didnt really share with me that he would be interested in doing this again, but actively tried really hard to get me back during his abroad experience and when he returned). I dated around a bit when he was gone but hes the only guy I’ve ever slept with. 

Hes the type of guy thats funny without ever really trying to be. Hes thoughtful and selfless; he offers to switch shifts for people, he helps my mom clean up after dinner when we come over, he loves our dog like his own blood, etc. Hes always in a great mood, even after a tough day and always has a smile on his face. Even in quarantine, when I wake up and walk to the kitchen where he works he greets me with a huge grin and pulls me onto his lap. Hes content with life the way it is and doesnt exactly strive for much else, meaning if I didnt ask he would probably be fine living in our 650 sq foot apt for the next few years. He works an amazing job at an amazing company and has gotten a promotion in the 3 years hes worked there which is incredible and I am so so proud of him. 

I am the opposite. I cant sit still with life and am constantly striving for “whats next”. When can we get a house finally, where can we travel next, what new recipe can I cook up for dinner, when should we have kids, etc. I’m very business savvy because my Dad taught me to be like this, I can negotiate salary at a new job very well (I switched jobs 3 times last year). I dont know what I want out of life and never settle for less, I always am striving for more. 

Sam loves my drive and my motivation, but sometimes I struggle with the lack of his. I feel like I have to push him sometimes to do things or think about things a certain way, biggest example is houses and starting a life together and building equity. Sam can be insecure sometimes and not really initiate sex as much as I would like him to, and our sex life is pretty vanilla. But again, hes the only person I’ve ever been with so maybe thats all I want I dont know.

I struggle with temper problems. I have the tendency to overthink a lot, am a deep introvert and have social anxiety sometimes. If I am upset, I either shut down or blow up. Tonight for example, I came home from my parents house and was upset about something and just wanted alone time. He came to bed and I woke up from his snoring and he asked me what was wrong. I told him I just really need to be alone, so he went to the couch. Sam hates confrontation and typically will just agree to what I bring up, but hes trying to get better at having a conversation about this.

Deep down we have a great friendship. We both love to travel. We love food and going out to restaurants and can sit for hours just talking to each other about anything and everything. We share the same viewpoints about life and what we want out of it.

Sometimes, per my mothers comment I mentioned first...I wonder if I got it wrong. What she means is, she thought I would end up with someone more assertive, who would take the bull by the horns and lead the pack, whereas in this relationship I make the calls 99% of the time. 

Im scared what if my life ends up boring with Sam, or what if I am just settling for him. I know hes a wonderful guy. I know he will be a great Father someday. I know he treats me well and supports me to the fullest. I know this is stupid but I’m nervous I am settling. I dont feel a spark with him really, I dont roll over in bed and think wow what a hunk I have. Or think about him constantly. I love him deeply of course, maybe this is just quarantine thoughts since we have been together 24/7...I just want others opinions if they have felt the same way in a relationship, or if this is something to really sit and think about.

"Hey all,

I’m an 18 year old male from the UK looking for a woman who doesn’t mind my foot fetish. I’ve only had one girlfriend before, who HATED my foot fetish and shamed me for it whenever I brought it up. That relationship ended several months ago (because of something unrelated) and now I’m looking to meet somebody new. However, I’d prefer it if I could date somebody who is inclusive of my foot fetish. The current lockdown situation requires this is online for a while, but I’m also seeking advice regarding irl dating.

I’ve tried online dating in the past and haven’t had a great deal of success with it. At best, I’m slightly above-average in the looks department but I CANNOT TAKE GOOD PHOTOS. As a result, I don’t mention my foot fetish to my matches as I don’t want to scare them off (sadly, people seem to frown upon foot fetishes, despite them being common) especially given that I don’t get too many due to not being particularly photogenic. Dating sites tailored specifically to foot fetishes are probably my best bet - although I’m quite secretive about my fetish so I worry that people I personally know could find me. Additionally, all foot-specific dating sites seem to be paid and aren’t affordable at this time. 

It’s worth mentioning that my foot fetish isn’t extreme - I can get off without feet but in a relationship I would still require a fair amount of sexual footplay. If a partner wanted sex to mostly revolve around footplay, then I’d be cool with that too. I’m also a sub/switch.

Are any of you guys here in relationships with somebody who has or is accepting of your foot fetish? If so, what advice would you give to me in finding a partner who does the same? Should I go about dating regularly and bring up the foot fetish later into any relationship that develops, or is it better to exclusively look for women who enjoy having their feet worshipped or at least don’t mind it? 

Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: I’m unsure how to approach relationships and dating as I have a foot fetish, which girls tend to be very uncomfortable with.",relationships
"Hi, so we lived together for 3 years before I decided to move interstate for grad school 2.5 years ago. Long distance was going okay but the disconnect has become more and more obvious. When I moved there was a goal of him moving up after a year but it never happened. I decided it had to be his decision and not one I made for him ... it never ended up happening. After settling on the fact that he had good reasons not to move, we stopped talking about it and I’ve now realised that as a consequence I’ve but the romantic aspects of the relationship ‘on hold’ (kind of ‘checked out’). 

We’ve both felt the disconnect, and we had a long conversation a week ago. At first he said that I had to decide, to which I finally said that I didn’t want him to move because I’m feeling uncertain and that our relationship has felt strained for a long time. He then back flipped and said that he didn’t understand how I could throw six years away and that he would move. He says I’m still his whole world and that he’s willing to try anything to make sure he doesn’t have any regrets about not trying. I agreed to try, I think primarily out of fear of ending it (sort of freaked myself out when I said he shouldn’t move which implicitly meant we were finished). 

I’m worried he is deciding to move out of fear. I’m uneasy about him deserting his support systems and his career to move here for me. I feel unsure about our relationship - I feel love for him like I do my close friend but I’m not certain I can recommit myself to a relationship that I feel like I put on hold so quite a while ago. And to be honest, my decision to move interstate was slightly motivated to find myself outside of the relationship which I entered into when I was 18. 

I’m so confused about how I went from feeling like I was doing the responsible thing and ending it, to agreeing that he should move up. Do I tell him again that he shouldn’t move? Is my uncertainty reason enough to end it?


Tdlr - partner has started to prepare to relocate to me after almost breaking up. I’m feeling uncertain about the relationship and I feel he’s making this decision out of fear of our relationship ending.",relationships
"About 6-7 months ago, I ended a 5 year relationship. He's a good person. I still keep some mutual friends we had. I have emailed my ex in the past and have been understandably ignored. I ended things despite him wanting to make the effort to compromise even more things for me. I realized what we both wanted was too different to sustain marriage/kids. I am in a happier relationship now (although still really new).

Over that 5 year relationship, I got to know a lot of my ex's close friends through Skype (He has friends who live all over the place). We played some games together. It takes a while for me to get comfortable with people, and I'm re-learning this through meeting my current partner's friends. When I broke up with my ex, I removed his friends off of my Skype list stupidly. I regret doing that. I don't even know how they feel about me. I don't know how my ex explained the break-up to them.

"I \[25F\] went to university at the same time as my boyfriends \[25M\] of three years group of friends. They were absolute a\*\*holes who treated girls like objects and did nothing but drink and do drugs. These group of boys, about 5 or 6 of them, also made an instagram account and posted my bikini photos  (among other girls) on it, zooming in on my breasts. They asked people to rate them, comparing them to other girls, etc. It was so infuriating and I, along with the other girls, made them delete the account. Can I add, they made this account this while me and my boyfriend were dating?!

My boyfriend met this group of friends while on an exchange at my university and is still mates with them. I absolutely hate them and want nothing to do with them, I think they're losers and what they did was disrespectful. He often wants to hang out with them and drink. I wouldn't normally have an issue with that, but I **hate** these boys!!! He has another group of friends which are great guys, and I have no problem with him seeing them. They definitely haven't matured since university. I'm disappointed that my boyfriend even wants to hang out with them after everything.

Am I being unreasonable for asking him to not hang out with them?

TL;DR, my boyfriend is friends with a bunch of guys who used to post photos of me in a bikini on an instagram account, asking people to rate them. My boyfriend is mates with them and always wants to see them, drink, etc. I absolutely hate them for what they did and think they are losers. They definitely haven't matured since university. Am I being unreasonable for asking him to not hang out with them?

Update: I had a serious chat with my boyfriend about his friend group - asked him why he is still friends with them and how much they disrespected and hurt me. He understood my feelings and said they were valid. He agreed with me and said he would cut them out of his life. He has a few other friend groups that he will now hang out with instead. He apologised for continuing to be friends with them and will no longer associate with them. Hopefully he stays true to his word, otherwise I'm out of the relationship, and he knows  that.

"I've been with my boyfriend for two years. My boyfriend's parents are divorced, so he has two sets of parents. I get along decently with one set (his dad and stepmom): normal conversation, get invited to Christmas, etc. It's a little awkward, but I can see that they're making an effort. His other parents, though, (his mom and stepdad), don't talk to me AT ALL when I visit. Here are some things that happened the first time I went over:

* They talked to me through him.
   * EX: I washed the dishes after dinner, and instead of thanking me, she said, ""Thanks guys,"" even though my boyfriend was only standing there talking to me.
   * She didn't ask me what school I go to, what I study, how are my parents, ANYTHING!! Easy conversation topics, in my opinion. But she asked my boyfriend when I left?????
* My boyfriend was a hot mess before I met him, and he enrolled in college a year ago. My mom didn't want him to have unsubsidized student loans, so she loaned him the money and said he could pay her back when he graduates without interest. I taught him how to drive, and my brother got him a job at a nice sushi restaurant to help pay for the next year of college.
   * His first set of parents (dad and stepmom) wrote me a Christmas card with tons of nice things in it acknowledging the positives he's experienced since dating me and how they're grateful, but his mom never said a word. did not even ask how my mom was doing. I'm Asian (he's white), so in my culture, this is extremely disrespectful.
* My comments at dinner fell on deaf ears and there was a lot of awkward silence after until my boyfriend entertained my conversation. I stopped talking after 3 attempts.
* Her dog hates me. I can't walk one foot without him trying to attack me and she said: ""He just has a lot of baggage!""

Normally, this wouldn't be too much of a problem since I don't see her much, but with COVID, he moved out of his dad's (immunocompromised) place and is living with his mom. That makes the drive between our houses increase from 20 minutes to 45 minutes. To be fair, I volunteered to visit him half the time, and he visits me the other half of the time. However, during my visit yesterday, the same awkward things happened. My boyfriend defends her all the time saying his mom is just ""not sociable with strangers,"" but we've been together for two years. Is it unreasonable to expect her to make an effort to get to know me? My mom, who barely knows English, tries to talk to him all the time when he's over! It's just really distressing, and I don't think I can come over again if she's going to treat me like that. I've asked my boyfriend to ask her why she doesn't talk to me, but he says that an ""awkward conversation I don't want to have."" This situation makes me so angry, and I've been keeping my lips shut to prevent an argument. So reddit, what should I do? Should I ignore the way she makes me feel and make my boyfriend solely come over to my house?  Should I confront her about it next time I come? I don't know what I want really. I guess I want to know if someone has experienced the same thing and how that panned out for your relationship because I'm afraid this might tear our relationship apart. He's such a mommy's boy even though I was more of a mother than she was.

TLDR: My boyfriend's mom won't talk to me when I'm over and it's really awkward. Does she hate me? What should I do to get her to talk to me?  How will this pan out if our relationship continues?

"My bisexual girlfriend of 1 and a half years explained to me that she’s been confused about her sexuality for a long time, and has told me that she sexually feels more comfortable with girls, but loves me for who I am and doesn’t want to lose me.

She says that it’s not anything about feelings or wanting relationships with other girls, but instead just the satisfaction of feeling another girl (think one night flings at clubs), but not having a relationship with them.

She says she loves me more than anything and she wants to grow old with me (that type of love), and that she does feel satisfaction when we have sex, but just not in the way that she feels with other women (and so i’ve been told that it’s normal for women to know how to please other women.... because they’re also women).

She doesn’t have any personal attraction at all, it’s just purely sexual, and she says that she’ll tell me everything that happens (like making out at clubs and things), and that she does not want to “cheat” on me at all (cheating would only be if i’m not okay with her doing something). 

Any thoughts, advice, recommendations, and insight into if this would lead anywhere, and if this would be considered as cheating?

Personally, I think i’m comfortable with it as long as i’m still satisfied and if my girlfriend is happy, because I do love her in every way; more than just sexual, and she loves me for who I am (also more than just sexual).

"So I’ve been dating a guy for almost a year now and in my eyes, things were going great. We’ve had a few arguments, which mostly occurred because I was in a rough place when we first met.

We met through a dating site and due to past bad experiences, I was actually not expecting a relationship to come out of it. But things developed and we got on extremely well, have many things in common and a similar outlook on where we want to be.

My past relationships have always been with mentally unstable guys I’ve been trying to fix, but I’ve since learnt this is toxic and what we have now is true partnership, and recently I’ve been desperately trying to keep it civil and drama free, however I’m starting to feel like I cannot express what goes through my mind. 

We’re both living a distance apart and the initial plan before lockdown was to move in together this summer, which has been put on hold as he doesn’t have a job (studying an online graphics course atm) and will need to secure one before we move forward. 

I am completely supportive and understanding of his needs, try to always see it from his perspective and give him all the time needed. I’m employed currently and also attempting to develop creative skills, though motivation has always been hard for me and I’m trying to change that because he has voiced his concerns on how he thinks I’m not doing enough with my free time. I’m finding it really hard to explain myself without finding excuses (I’m from a single parent family and way far behind everyone my age in terms of personal development, purely because I was never given any direction in younger years and have not succeeded in school etc so had to work things out myself whilst also dealing with extreme anxiety which onset depression, but I’ve since left this in the past)

When I ask him about how he pictures the future, he is unsure and keeps his options open, applying to jobs abroad (we live in U.K.) and mainly talking about his career and development. This is great, however it feels as though I’m not really in the picture. Then I receive conflicting signals, like he will be looking at renting a place near me and also finding work there. When I try to figure out if he actually wants us to continue being together he says it’s “undecided” and he’s not sure I do enough to prove to him I’m going to progress and be more motivated.

We’ve had arguments in the past where I got too emotional and upset over his coldness towards me. I know he’s an emotionally closed off person and this isn’t an issue, I don’t need to hear “I love you” everyday. But my issue is, he just carries on talking to me as normal whilst I know we haven’t cleared the air from past arguments, then it comes out of the blue and anything I say is invalid. 

For example: I saw him recently after 2 months apart. He stayed over, we had fun and sexy times and everything felt back to normal. When I brought up our relationship, he said he didn’t come over to talk about this and just wanted to hang out. Also he said it in a way like he done me a favour, because I said before it’ll be nice to see him soon. He drove down near where I live to collect some things from another flat and dropped by. I thought he wanted to see me, but it just sounded like he came to have sex and was on his way the next day. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know he’s not a user. He respects me and has good morals, but I can tell something is on his mind and simply want to talk it through, in a completely rational and adult manner. But he always sees it as an argument, gets stressed and shuts off. I’m scared now of bringing anything up and just go along with it, because I fear of him dumping me. What I also fear is him getting his life sorted without me in it, then eventually cutting me off whilst all this time I’m under the impression we will be together in the foreseeable future.

Basically I’m just looking on how to deal with this situation in the best way and not ending up disappointed and hurt. I do love this person so much and just wish we can completely clear things up and start fresh. I know from side, I need to really try harder in developing personal skills and pursuing the creative career I want in the future, however I’m finding it difficult whilst constantly thinking whether this will work out. He can switch off and get on with things, but I overthink and it stops me from doing things to improve myself. It’s like being stuck in a loop where I know this is what’s expected of me, but I can’t do it unless my mind is at peace and we’re both on the same page. I’ve given it months and months without saying anything and trying to just work on myself but it would massively help if I could just have one conversation about the situation without him turning on me and treating it like it’s not important. 


TL;DR : Trying to talk to my boyfriend about our relationship but he isn’t willing to clear things up and instead pushes it aside, which is causing me to worry and I can’t be in the right mindset to improve the thins  I need to work on for us to stay together.",relationships
"I’m a 28f dealing with my mom 52f on Facebook now which seems to be her entire life. I have a moderately active social media presence... I post frequently to Instagram but not more than the normal 28 year old. And I rarely use facebook, mainly to wish people a happy birthday AND the one main reason is for my mom. 

My mom is obsessive over Facebook. If it’s her birthday and she got gifts she has to post them on Facebook; what she got and who she got them from. For her birthday we need to create a post for her or she gets upset. She has us to do one for our dad too who doesn’t even have Facebook.... last year he even asked us to stop posting. We have to do a post for Mother’s Day, etc. I remember once she forwarded me a photo of her friend and her daughter baking cookies together and she asks me “why don’t we bake!” She is constantly comparing. She spends literally her entire day on Facebook, sending me videos every hour about things she’s seen there or reposting a million articles. In the wake of coronavirus it’s only gotten so much worse. She posts like 15 times a day different COVID articles, ones about masks, not wearing masks, people who are dead, what state has the most cases, what an anti vaxxer said, etc. It’s gotten to the point where one of her friends literally commented “you need to take a break from all this negative information, it’s not good for you.” She agreed on the post and then just continued posting. 

But this morning she shared that “plandemic” video and at that point I’d just had enough. I told her she was spewing misinformation on purpose, which she claims to have “researched”... and I told her I was going to delete my Facebook because seeing all this info all the time is not good for my mental health and watching her and her friends all agree that COVID is a conspiracy is distressing. She got mad and said “we won’t always agree on everything.” And while that’s true I honestly find this like a huge fundamental difference between us and makes me not want to talk to her. 

What can I do about this?

"Previously posted on AITA but it’s interpersonal conflict so I had to move here (not a copy and paste, I rewrote because there were flaws in my original post). Also forgot some details that seemed important.
So yesterday I didn’t say Happy Mother’s Day to my step mom because my relationship with my parents has become strained at best. I’m still reliant on them, but I’m moving out as soon as possible. 
I moved in with them 3 years ago, from my birth mom’s who I don’t speak with anymore because of emotional abuse. However, because of that, because I was lied to an manipulated and guilt tripped, I am really hard headed.
2 years ago, I came out as a trans man. They weren’t supportive at all. Outside of friends I had no support. Without the support, I was very suicidal. I’ve gained some support in the last two years, but I have been called “delusional”, I’ve been told not to talk about it with my younger siblings with has wrecked that relationship because I have to lie to them all the time, etc. Their church community is incredibly homophobic and transphobic. They aren’t blatant about it, but they are. They advocate for conversion therapy out for the world to see though. 
I gave up trying to educate them. I started getting into the punk scene too, I enjoy it and it makes people uncomfortable which I’m all for, plus my politics align with that subculture (my parents and I have argued about politics a lot).
I want to have a relationship with them, but even I’ve communicated how I feel it turns into a yelling match and the conversation turns to their feelings and not mine. I’ve been told that if I didn’t like how I was treated that I should move back in with my birth mom (my abuser). 
There’s so much hurt I don’t know how to have a conversation with them. I hide in my room and pay for all/at least most of my own things to limit talking to them so it doesn’t turn to an argument.
They like to take my younger siblings on trips without inviting me or telling me until they are walking out the door. I get it. I don’t wanna go, I really don’t want to go. But at least ask so I can say no. Whenever I’ve confronted them about it, they always make excuses when the plans were made when my schedule can bend anyway. 
They did that Sunday, they left while I was at work telling me 30 minutes before I had to go to work. Left for Mother’s Day. 
On top of the frustration and abandonment that makes me feel already, they’re *supposed to be staying home*. We are living in a global pandemic you’re not supposed to drive 3 hours away! The fact they did that disgusts me. It made me so mad. I’m an “essential” worker. I’m a cashier, I have to help people that are breaking lockdown to buy hundreds of dollars worth of clothes while bodies pile into my store while we are understaffed, overworked, and underpaid. 
So that situation was anger inducing to me. It felt so, “well I want to go out of town and I should if I so desire”. 
Again, I’m really trying to move out. After I move out? I don’t know how to have a relationship with them. Once I’m transitioning I won’t look like a daughter anymore. How can I have a relationship with my younger siblings if I can’t tell them? There’s so much going on here, years of just bs that’s it’s hard condense. 
I’m so angry about our relationship because I can’t find it in me to be sad anymore. Being sad about it almost cost me my life and I can’t bend how they want me to. 
Any perspectives I should consider? Or anything I should add?

"Tl;dr my partner is still married but separated for over a year, how do I support him?

This is on my main account because honestly I want some advice. If either of them stumble upon it it's not incriminating to me.

So my partner and his wife have been separated for over a year, we have been together for around 7 months. What was to be their anniversary was last week, thanks Facebook for your ""memories"" feature. It upset him to remember how happy he was that day and so was his wife. She massaged him about how she cried and was sorry that she ruined everything by cheating.

My issue is mostly with helping him deal with some of the emotions that get brought up but things like this. I'm rather inexperienced in life seeing as I've never been married or lived alone. I adore my partner and I would like some advice as to the best way to help him in these times. I understand this isn't dramatic or exciting but any advice is welcome. :)",relationships
"A little background my ex is a DJ and that's actually how we met. He was going through a horrible divorce. He was married for about a year and was with her for six years. We have been together for two. I'm 27 weeks pregnant with our first child. He has been very aloof for lack a better term about the pregnancy. 

About six weeks before all this quarantine stuff happened I walked in to his house and found him cheating. We used to split our time 50/50 between our places. I had already left for work, but drove back at lunch to grab a file I left and found them. It was honestly the worst thing I've ever dealt with. I'm feeling ok-ish now, but because I'm home all the time think about it a lot.

I told him I needed space. He reluctantly agreed and when the quarantine order rolled around he wanted to quarantine together. I didn't. So we've been separate. I text him occasionally baby updates (how I'm feeling, kicks, etc) or pictures of the bump. He has been calling and texting me non stop. I strictly only respond if it's about the baby. He stopped over today with flowers and a gift for Mother's Day. At first it was going really well (we maintained distances and both wore masks), but then before he was leaving he tried to hook up, which set me off.

I'm still really hurt he cheated on me and who knows what he's been up to during this time. He claimed nothing, but I don't trust him anymore. I guess I'm looking for advice on what to do? Half of my friends like him and the other half don't. My mom thinks I should be dating someone in the same profession as me and has never liked him. So any help would be great.

"We dated for five months.  (22/f, 28/m).  Halfway through we split up for a week because she was having doubts.  She came running back pretty quickly.  

After getting back together the next two months were great.  Only to be met with more sudden doubts this past weekend.  We broke up Saturday citing 

“I still have all these doubts that I rushed into this.  I was with the same guy for nine years and I never took time to process that or find myself after that.”. She told me she had messaged him during our relationship asking if he thought there was anyway they’d ever get back together.  He said he didn’t know. 

I am absolutely crushed.  I loved this girl in a way she’d never been loved.  I showed her how she deserved to be treated, and I loved her whole heartedly.  I believe she did me too as well.  She would always say and do the sweetest most loving things.  

After we split she quickly deleted all social media posts.  It seems this is final.  

My specific question is there anyway in which she will come back in the future? I can’t shake this feeling that our love was real and genuine.  I want to believe that in time she will realize that.  In my previous experiences though, girls tend not to come back after having doubts.  Any insight would be appreciated.

"
My boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) have been together for about three and a half years at this point. When we first started dating, he told me he didn’t want to keep any secrets from me and told me that this mother was an abusive alcoholic while he was growing up. While the abuse has stopped (I think a large part of this is just that he towers over her at this point) she’s still drinking, despite his dad sinking thousands into trying to get her help. 

She didn’t like when he moved in with her again for six months after leaving the military, but now that he has moved out, rarely answers her calls, and genuinely doesn’t need her, she’s all about having us visit her so we can see her “projects” (aka what she forces her poor husband to do for her, despite the fact that she sits on her ass drinking all day). 

These visits usually turn into her telling us all about some useless, outdated info like it’s brand new (latest example would be the stimulus checks, we’ve all heard about them and they’ve been coming out for a while now) and how we should spend those. And when challenged or corrected, she becomes defensive and straight up nasty, it is almost comical how wrong she is sometimes, but you don’t dare correct her. 

In addition, she also has a habit of bringing my boyfriend weird stuff like half-used detergent( usually old, pretty sure she got bored of it and wants to get rid of it) watered down hand soap in old olay containers, extremely awkward-looking bedding or used towels (he lives in a log home and she brings over a blue and white silky, floral comforter and old teal towels we already bought our own quilt and towels that we like, and continue to buy our necessary soaps etc) and trinket-type things to “decorate”. 

It seems like she is trying to still force her relevancy in my boyfriends life, and while he just ignores her and just tolerates her for the most part when she’s around, I can’t see why he would want someone who made his life a living hell around anymore. If I were him, I would just write her off completely, and not see her anymore. 

I’m struggling with forgiving her and letting it all go, it’s just makes me bitter and protective of my boyfriend when she comes around. I also need some help finding a tactful way to tell her that we don’t need any more of her junk. 

TL;DR, How do I deal with my boyfriends previously abusive, alcoholic, overbearing, narcissistic mother?

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with a woman like this?",relationships
"I found someone who is perfect for me about 9 months ago but I had to move for college and the timing was just bad so we talked for quite some time before we started dating. I got to finally meet him in person and things were amazing. Unfortunately the fun had to come to an end as our time in person was up and I had to leave. We have been apart for a little over a month now and I have started to really feel disconnected. Like I don’t even want to talk to him anymore  I don’t want to lose this person but I just don’t know how to let them love me with the distance. I’ve been hurt so many times before that trying to do long distance was probably not the best idea but I don’t want to break up with him but I’ve been so rude and tempered for no reason. 

He also has never been in a relationship so dealing with how I am feeling is extremely challenging and I feel bad that he has to listen to me cry on the phone. 

If I want to make things work I have to get used to the distance but I’m just having such a hard time because of how much of a negative peers on I have become and can never look at things positivity

"So, my SO (25M) and I have been dating for almost 2 years. Things were generally good until quarantine...

Quarantine has been intensifying my feelings and thoughts and I just feel extra depressed. I'm stuck in my head a lot, and I came into terms that there's anxiety too. I feel the nausea, loss of energy, numbness, rapid heart rate, and basically the symptoms you find on google. I feel like quarantine forced me to face my internal problems and they're issues that were always in the back burner. Some things I finally came into terms with below...

1. I learned that I don't care for sex at all. Obviously new relationship you get the high, but with normal relationships they still want to have sex and have urges to do it with each other. It's not enjoyable for me and I don't really want to do it. I feel like my libido never matched others, and I try to force myself to like it, when really I don't. And my SO really doesn't want DB, and I'm sure my libido isn't going to change affected by depression or not. I feel like I'm being unfair to him and not being able to provide what he needs.
2. I learned that I require someone more empathetic. I've had history of men or coincidentally they have not been as understanding to how I feel, and I get dismissed. Or they don't listen. It's not that I don't try to help them explain or express what I need but it falls short. When that happens I just don't feel like trying anymore. I always thought okay, that's just how it is, but it doesn't need to be.
3. I learned that I've always went into relationships because I yearned for a best friend. Someone to get really close with and share everything. With romantic relationships it can quickly happen (I think at least for me) versus platonic relationships takes time to build (some are lucky and they're found a bestie right away). Even if I'm dating someone, I still felt lonely. I really want a female best friend, but I don't have one because it's hard to make connections and I haven't found the right girl that I feel very comfortable with. I feel like if I had a best friend, I wouldn't really care for a relationship either... It's not right for me to do that and it's unfair to whoever I'm dating.
4. I learned that I become more aggressive when I'm stressed or down, and I keep snapping at him. It reminds me of my father and I hate that. I wouldn't date someone like that, yet I'm doing the same thing. I feel disgusted with myself. I remember my ex said he was worried that I would start to snap and be mean to him all the time. I'm already doing that with my own boyfriend, and I can't stop. I know what I'm doing is wrong and I apologize but I want to stop doing that from the start. I've grown annoyed to small things.
5. I learned that maybe I'm falling out of love when there's no reason for me to. It bugs me so much that he's such a nice guy, and he tries to help. But I feel nothing. Maybe it's because of depression but I don't feel the need to love.

I'm sure I know what I should do after writing all of this... But I know I need to work on myself a whole lot. To improve my mentality and love myself more. I just absolutely hate myself. My self confidence and will to even function is out the window. If I let him go, I know I'll be lonelier and he'll be unhappy too. I'm worried if he understands me and what I'm saying, because whenever someone uses ""it's me, not you"" sounds like bullshit, but it's not. It literally is just me, and I'm so overwhelmed with my emotions and things I want to do in my life that I don't want him to be on the sidelines. And dealing with someone who is overly emotional is exhausting. I feel like a burden.

I guess I just want some thoughts, am I crazy, is this just because of quarantine, etc?

tl;dr

Quarantine made me feel more depressed and I end up realizing I'm not fit to be in a relationship, but my bf is so good and kind. BUT I feel nothing and I need to work on myself, is that ok?",relationships
"I’ve [28 M] have been with my GF [32 F] for one year now. She has a lot of amazing characteristics, supports me in business, stress, cooks for me, always taking care of me, etc

The one part I have a hard time with is her with my family and friends. It’s Mother’s Day and she’s complaining about me going to see her, saying they’re toxic and not good for me to be around and anytime it comes up, comes an argument, it infuriates her. I can’t tell at times whether she’s manipulating or controlling or supportive tbh. I cut contact with my family for the past six months (talking here and there) for her, and that’s not even good enough. She says it’s this or I pack my things and leave. 

We get in arguments a lot and usually it’s because she thinks I’m cheating (which I would never do) or because of my family or something related to it, and it feels like I have to walk on eggshells

"My first love.

So I’m a (19M) and this girl(19F) I fell in love with back in early highschool/8th grade, whom I was(and still am) utterly in love with and just made the dumb decision as a teenager to break up with for another girl... which I will regret for the rest of my life... honestly she’s was and is perfect...started talking and hanging out a lot again... it’s been along time since we actually saw one another or talked frequently up until about 2 months ago when she called me crying and sobbing about a boyfriend who was making her feel lonely and such... after she had broken up with him I started driving about an hour or so multiple times a week to see her cause I wanted to be there for her and comfort her in her time of need... I also I really feel like she was and is the love of my life... and I love being around this woman. She honestly makes me feel so many things no one else can. We have been hanging out about 90% of the time aside from me going to work for the last 2 months, throughout this time we have told one another we love them, are in love with them, we miss them when they aren’t around... etc...I want to be with her romantically and try to not fuck it up this time since I’ve grown as a person... and I’m not a dumb highschool kid anymore... I want that chance, that opportunity... but I feel like she’s scared and doesn’t want to try... which with what I did to her back then I understand, I’d be hesitant too... i was a shitty person to do that and I wouldn’t make that same mistake twice... anyhow I worry a lot and have severe abandonment issues I feel... so there is a lot of moments where I’m angry or sad or just worried that she doesn’t want me or is going to lose interest in me and leave like I did to her almost 5 years ago... idk I guess what I’m asking for advice is, what is your guys and gals opinion...? Am I just overthinking or?... I really want to be with her and we’ve talked about it but.. idk. I’m just worried, any one else go through soemthing like this? I really just need some comments on whatever I’m going through it’d help a lot. I really hope this woman I love realizes just how much I care for her.

"i've been with my bf for 7 months now. i've only had one other relationship before and it was only 4 months but it was my first love and the guy broke up with me because we fought too much (i learned this is an issue i have).

I connect really well with my bf, I can talk to him deeply and I also feel good about myself because he seems very in love with me. the biggest thing for me was that I felt like he wanted me as well whereas in the past I always felt like I had to present myself as the best version of myself so I could earn love, with my bf I feel like I can just be me and I don't worry about him not wanting me. In my worst times, like ready to jump of a bridge, he's been there for me and no one ever has been there for me like that. I really care about him and love him, but that's just when things are good, and it feels like things aren't good majority of the time. Sometimes he can be insensitive, he constantly makes sexual jokes when I just want to have a normal conversation, I always have to repeat ""no"" (sometimes i like that he pushes me to say yes because it helps me step out of my comfort zone, but sometimes i wish he would just accept my answers instead of trying to change my mind, although he doesn't force anything, i just get frustrated having to repeat myself), and the biggest issue of all that we have is that our life plans don't line up.

he wants to have kids someday, i don't. he says that i may feel that now but i could change my mind in the future, and i said the same for him. i told him if he wants kids that bad then he should go have it with someone else because under no circumstance am i having a kid, and he said that he would be okay with not having kids because more than anything he just wants to be with me, but he still is holding out hope i'll change my mind. 

what bothers me is that i had this ideal in my head of the perfect relationship for me, like someone whose values and views line up with mine, who wants the same things, someone who is really romantic and affectionate and will make me feel loved all the time, i often feel like i wish i could take half of my ex and half of my bf and i'd probably get the perfect boyfriend for me. my bf and I fight a lot because I get upset a lot by the way he acts and I always just feel like this relationship isn't gonna last because it's not everything i wanted, but at the same time sometimes i wonder if i'm just thinking too ideally and that if i leave thinking the grass might be greener, i'll just end up with regret and alone. sometimes i think that i want all these things from a partner, but what if someone like that wouldn't even want me? what if this is the relationship for me based on what i deserve?

when i think of my bf now, i don't feel very in love. i have moments where i do, but i feel like that might just be more so loneliness and a need to feel loved than being in love because if it was love i would feel it all the time. i've told him about my doubts, but he says he's sure he wants to marry me someday and that i'm the only one for him. i don't think i feel the same way, but i want to be with him now because i don't have much figured out yet (he knows this) and i still do feel something for him. i keep watching these relationship advice videos and i feel so envious of their relationships and i know it takes work to make it work but sometimes i just wonder if i'm doing it for the wrong person. i'm afraid of making a mistake i'll regret. the thought of breaking up with my bf and him moving on makes me upset, but the thought of staying forever also makes me upset.

 i don't know what to do. i don't want to not be with him right now, but i also feel guilty because my feelings aren't consistent, some days i'm lovey dovey and some days i want him to just disappear for a bit. i don't know if this is just how i'll always be in relationships and i should stay and work this one out with someone i feel comfortable working on myself with. it just feels like i'm waiting for the day that the relationship stops serving me and then i'd move on, like i know i don't want to be with him forever but there's still stuff i want to learn and experience. i don't know, maybe i'm just a terrible person and deserve to be alone for thinking this way, i just feel like i can't handle that regret if i possibly fuck up the only good thing i'll ever have

tldr; i'm not sure if i'm in love with my boyfriend and i don't want to be with him forever, but i don't feel ready to leave the relationship",relationships
"I (23m) started talking to this girl (23f) from a popular dating app just as lockdown started and we've been messaging every day for the last 7 weeks. We've spoken on the phone loads and we watch a film together every weekend. 

We're keen on each other and neither of us has been messaging other people. The problem is that lockdown for us has just been extended for at least another 2 months. 

I'm worried that I'm getting too attached to a person I've never actually met. Currently it feels as if we're starting a relationship without ever seeing one another. What if we don't click when we actually meet up?

On the other hand, what if we run out of things to talk about over the next 2 months and drift apart as a result? Two months feels like a very long time.

"I’m a young female intern that works and gets her own money. It isn’t that much but because I’m a uni student and live with my fam, I don’t have to spend money on rent. I do tend to buy a lot of nice stuff for myself because I am in a position to do so and because it’s the first time in my life I could buy all these nice stuff for myself. Yes I do put some money aside for savings. 

My colleagues (most of them have young families) or some in their mid 20s (who earn way more than I do and live with their parents), joke that they are paying me too much. 

It really hurts me because to me it seems that they think the work I put in isn’t good enough and that I should be paid lower. It’s like I’m not working hard enough even though I always volunteer to help or work long hours. Moreover, I take great pride in the work I do and I’m someone who doesn’t like being a sloppy team member. I  love to work hard and do well.  I’m happy to reflect that I’m not smart in the field I’m in but I’m always willing to learn and improve myself. 

Also, the situation makes me so angry because those in their 20s who earn way more than I do and live with their parents can afford to buy themselves these nice stuff. Also I didn’t decided to have kids, so I don’t have that extra expense 

Part of me thinks I should say in a joking manner ‘ahaha how much do you think I should get paid’ in order to catch them off guard and make them awkward. However I’m not sure it will come off as a joke and more of an aggressive confrontation since I’m just angry. 

I’m sorry for the mess it’s just that I’m letting these feelings get to me. It makes me cry and be angry at the same time. 

I honestly don’t know how to handle this situation. Any advice would be appreciate it.

"TL;DR should I have more experience in dating and relationships at the age of 24? Will it affect my next relationship?

When it comes to dating i have little to no experience. I have had one girlfriend that turned into an abusive relationship. It was abusive from both parties Long story short we mutually split up because we had different values on sex. Although I will say she was one of the good ones ya know. She was what I would consider my first love. Which doe not mean much because she was my only long term girlfriend.

After that relationship i basically have fallen into a hole of only working on myself and not putting myself out there enough. I'm honestly afraid to because of reasons of: getting hurt again, losing focus on my goals, and being the person I was in the last relationship. I'm attempting to get myself out there little by little. The biggest struggle for me is staying fun and attractive to who I am attracted to but that I'd not the question here.

I'm 24 years old, my goals are still far out from reach and I feel like I'm losing the experience I need to be man that a women wants.

"(We've been together 1 year.)

For example,  on Friday I wanted to go on a jog with a friend;  the area where I live is on lockdown, but we planned to jog down some of the closed-off roads two meters apart,  wearing masks.  (The lockdown does not require masks while exercising, but my friend is an essential worker so we wanted to be cautious.)  My partner told me that I couldn't go or else I couldn't come back, as I would be endangering his health. (edited for clarity)

When I brought up that he also went for a walk in masks with a friend whose partner is an essential worker last month,  he first denied that it ever happened,  and then,  after I showed him evidence to the contrary,  accused me of  ""looking for an excuse to be mad""  at him.  After some thought I realised that he does this  ( that is, accuses me of  ""picking fights""  and  ""trying to destroy the relationship"" )  whenever we fight and I bring up anything he's done,  in particular if he's holding me to a double standard or hasn't done something I've asked him to.

How do I convince him that my issues are in fact real?  Is that even what he means?  (I've tried asking him to clarify but he usually just gets upset that I'm ""reading too much"" into his words or that I'm still harping on about the conflict.)

"Basically my male best friend gave me an ultimatum because he knows I still have feelings for a guy who hurt me last year, I’ll call him J. My friend said ‘I’m only gonna say this once, but if I find out you’re talking to him again, we’re done.’

J has been trying to get in contact with me since  January and wanted a chance to explain and apologise to me. We got together and had sex quite quickly last year, then his ex came back on the scene and everyone including my other friends - we have mutual friends, said his ex had him wrapped around her finger and he even admitted it, he said he spent so much time chasing after something that wasn’t working out. I do believe this is the case because I don’t think he’s a bad person that was deliberately out to hurt me, I got caught up in things and he keeps bringing up how he wishes he could change that. 

I know this sounds like I’m second choice and maybe I’m wrong for accepting that but he really has been trying with me, messaging me 24/7, making sure I’m okay, opening up to me about the past etc. I’ve been a lot happier talking to him again and we’re talking about getting serious... I explained to him I’m moving away to pursue my career in law and he said he’s willing to make things work. 

I haven’t been this happy in a while but I’m still wary and he will have to prove to me that he really is serious and cares so I’m not a total mug...

The only thing is, I feel so guilty because I haven’t told my best friend we’re talking again, I feel like I’m being deceitful and I’m scared things get serious with J because this probably means I’ll lose my best friend but then in a sense I’ll resent my friend anyway for not allowing me to be happy - even if I’m making a mistake, I know he’s looking out for me in sense. I just feel like people deserve a second chance. 

 An ultimatum from someone I care about is really hurtful. I don’t dictate who he can and can’t see and what he does. I’m scared to tell him and don’t know how to because we always look out for each other. People have suggested he has feelings for me but I don’t think that’s the case as he always mentions other girls.

"There is talk of divorce between my parents (both in their 50's) who have been married for 20 years, and I (18) am unsure how to act. Below I’ll explain their grounds for divorce, alongside my thoughts. Sorry if the post is long-winded.

**Background**: my parents' relationship has been rocky from the start. After I was born, a divorce agreement was drawn up, and my father lived away from myself and my mother for a year. However, the divorce was never finalised, and he moved back in. One of the reasons might be due to pressure from the side of his family. We are Asian, and divorce is more frowned upon than in Western cultures.

However, they continued to fight. I do not remember exactly what most arguments were about but were probably due to lack of effective communication. They run a small family business: mother handles the clients and the operations, while father did the accounting and tech support. Many arguments also arose from this arrangement, which is explained from their points of view below. As their relationship soured, so did the way they interact with each other. They are currently sleeping in separate rooms, and they talk very little, except for basic things such as updating the grocery list and calling that dinner’s ready.  

**Father's POV**: he was the first to suggest divorce. He feels that my mother is micromanaging him. Father would be doing a task, for example doing the laundry, and mother would complain about many things that she feels isn’t being performed correctly, making him feel very restricted. Furthermore, he does not like mother’s style of communication. She communicates very ineffectively and would ask constantly round-about questions that serve no purpose. I personally agree with father with regards to the above two aspects.

Back before they started their family business, they had two options: either mother gives father a year or so to work on a project (he was in the IT industry), or mother runs the family business while father performs more of the non-essential business activities, along with most of the household chores. The second option was chosen. However, father feels that he was not given an opportunity to earn money and feels he hasn’t accomplished much in his life. 

**Mother's POV:** she is more hesitant towards divorce. She hasn’t really said much that suggests she wants a divorce, except she feels that my father is rude to her and only her, which I have noticed too. A reason she doesn’t want a divorce is that she’s worked very hard to support this family, only for it to break up. Both parents come from poor backgrounds and have had to work very hard to live a comfortable life we have now.

Another complaint of my mother is father tends to get physical during arguments. While they have not physically fought during an argument for a long time, father now tends to smash plates, which usually ends the argument. 

What is truly unfortunate is that my parents know why they dislike each other, but they are unwilling to change their behaviour. Therefore I, personally, support their divorce, with the following pros and cons:

**Pros**: this will almost immediately solve the problems my parents have that were explained above. Furthermore, the splitting of financial assets should be relatively straightforward, as they both seem not too concerned about who receives what. I feel somewhat selfish in saying this, but I will be able to go to university without having to worry about them fighting. They are still loving parents, and will still be supportive of me in the future.

**Cons**: at their age, my parents are unlikely to find a partner, which worries me as I may be not able to stay by their sides in the future due to studies and work. Furthermore, divorce almost certainly means shutting down their business, which means themselves and a handful of employees will be left jobless. However, finance is less of a concern for me. Despite my parents living frugally, they do have an investment property.

I feel like it is intuitively wrong for a child to support his parent’s divorce, but considering the above, what should I do? Please ask for more information if needed, and I’ll do my best to answer.

TL;DR: parents are discussing divorce, should I support their divorce?",relationships
"Pretty much the title. We had an argument over a week ago but it’s still on my mind, whether that’s because of quarantine or because it really affected me, who knows. 

To give background on the argument, it was about Instagram.... I know, I hate myself for being annoyed about it. Basically my boyfriend (23M) began following a few instagram/twitch girls (ones with big boobs - I’m very flat - and onlyfans - nothing wrong with it, just to give an indication of the content they post). In the past three years we’d been together he’d never followed accounts like that and I only noticed cause Instagram recommended them to me. 

I’d been feeling especially self conscious since my eczema has flared up really badly, I haven’t been able to workout properly and I haven’t “looked nice” since quarantine. Not to mention, cause of quarantine, we haven’t seen each other and haven’t had sex in months - pretty much when he started following these girls. 

So it really hurt finding that he just started following these girls. I brought it up with him - I tried to make it casual and like a joke at first but he got really angry and defensive. He started saying stuff like “why can’t I follow them huh”, “I wouldn’t care if you followed other guys”, “you’re so annoying”, and “I hate it when you get like this”. And i had to hang up and cry for 20min. Ever since I’ve been pretending everything’s okay. 

I want to talk about it again, just say that I’ve been feeling insecure and unattractive and that’s why it hurt, and also maybe to ask why he suddenly started following all these accounts? I also want to address how he handled me bringing it up and not even hearing me out properly. 

But I’m worried I’m just gonna back out. Part of me is also thinking it’s not worth it and I’m stupid for even making such a big deal out of it. I also feel not bothered because honestly we’ve barely talked since then. But I also can’t stop thinking about it.

"
My girlfriend just recently broke up with me because she felt guilty that her strict parents wouldn't let her see me, and that she needed to focus on school before summer when she starts online. We are going to colleges in different states. She was on the verge of tears and began to cry before we said goodbye. I remained calm and tried to be as stoic as possible because this girl means a lot to me.

Before we said goodbye she said how much she still cared about me and I said the same to her, and I told her that if she ever happens to be in the state I'm going to college in to let me know.

I just want to know if it's possible that later on she will reach out to me? I plan on going no contact and focusing on school and bettering myself, as I assume she will do the same. Is there a chance she'll contact me if I go no contact?

tl;dr: Is there a chance that my girlfriend and I can reconnect after or during college even though we are going to different schools?",relationships
"I am a lesbian (28) and have been in a relationship with my partner (31) for 6 years. My partner hasn't been very attentive for the past 2 years. I've recently fallen I love with the Korean language, so I joined an app where you meet people who can you can practice Korean with. My penpal is a native Korean man who has coincidently lived in my state (3 hours away) for the past 9 years. We have talked every day for the past 2 months and lately I have bee finding myself falling for him. He is very attentive, he asks me about my day, encourages me when I'm stressed about school, and is as kind as can be. I get butterflies every time he sends me a message. I don't feel the same about my partner anymore. I love her, but nowadays she acts more like a best friend. We show zero affection and she doesn't seem interested in my life anymore. For instance, today she came home from work and got in bed next to me without saying a word. I waited an hour before saying something because I wanted to see if she really isnt going to talk unless I say something. My penpal has expressed that he is feeling the same way and I am really conflicted on what to do. Since my partner and I live together it makes things so complicated.

TL;DR I love my partner,we live together and I don't want to lose her because we are so close, but I'm falling for my penpal.

"I'd  like to say that I've always been single by choice, but that would be a  complete lie. In fact, I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic. The closest to  a relationship I've ever gotten was when I was in middle school and I  told a friend I liked him because he confessed that he liked me. Nothing  ever came from that, partly because I didn't really like him as much as  I thought I did.

Then when I was  16/17 I had a growing friendship with this guy I thought was an awesome  person (spoiler, he was a bit of an ass) and I had developed really  strong feelings for him and was completely and utterly infatuated with  him as a person for over a year. I confessed my feelings and got  rejected, but we stayed friends. In fact, he started using me as a tool  to make his ex jealous and was toying with my emotions and I was too  naive to see it at the time.

But failed confessions and unrequited love aside, I think I might've actually found someone.

Just  as I was on the brink of throwing in the towel and getting a litter of  cats, out of the blue I get a reddit message from a guy who's interested  in getting to know me. (I had posted an ad in the realm of BDSM. Yes, I  was a bit desperate.) And from the pictures and videos he had on his  profile, I was more than intrigued to get to know him.

Not  only was he drop dead gorgeous, but he also wasn't some Indian guy  desperately begging for my attention (yes, I have noticed that I do  attract a type). We chatted a bit on reddit first, he was very  understanding, upfront and seemed genuinely interested in who I was as a  person and we sort of clicked. It was easy talking to him and we had  similar interests and expectations regarding where we would like this  endeavor to end up.

The next day we moved over to snapchat and continued to talk there, again, we just hit it off.

Now,  my post wasn't exactly PG 13 and neither were his photos, so after a  few days of chatting we started to test the waters and things were  getting steamier, but no pic or vid exchanges were made yet.

After  about a week of chatting we were having spicier and more, vivid,  exchanges alongside our already established friendly and cute chats.  Then I asked him what type of Dom he was, because in all honesty, I was  craving more dominance from him but he didn't exactly seem to pick up on  it.

He was confused and said that  he wasn't a Dom which honestly rattled me a little since that was what  my post was about... I said that it was okay and that I just assumed he  was because of my post. Though he didn't know much about what I was  talking about, he said that if it was something that I'm interested in,  he's be willing to try it.

So, we did. Well, as much as you can with get done with snapchat and it was pretty darn great.

Now we haven't really been chatting as much the last few days but then again, he's been busy with exams which I understand.

Though  he has mentioned to me that he only has one week of exams left then  he'll have more than enough time to focus his attention on me, which is  great, but I'm scared.

I've never  gotten further than 'I like you and you like me' before. I mean, we've  been rather honest with one another and he's said that I'm the sweetest  girl he's ever met and that he adores me. He's also the kindest,  sweetest, funniest person I've ever come across in my life and I feel  comfortable talking to him.

But  what if he's only in it for a quick fling? He said he was open to taking  things further if it felt right, but what if he didn't mean it? He  calls me gorgeous every chance he gets and compliments me on specifics  which I never get compliments for like my eyes, smile, voice, laugh,  hair and even things I'm insecure about like my body. He also asks how  I'm doing, how my day was and what's wrong or if I'm alright if I say it  was average. He also keeps telling me how cute I am, how he wants to  cuddle me, play with my hair, kiss me, rest his head on my thighs, sleep  next to me and pull my leg over him, he's super cute and will not let  me compliment him unless he can compliment me back. It feels real, like  he genuinely cares, but what if I'm wrong?

I  have no idea! I've never been in this situation before where someone  this amazing was actually interested in me and actually cares to listen  to my stupid ass.

Then comes the  second issue: Let's say he is actually genuinely interested in something  long term... how the heck do I move forward with that? I'm all talk and  no bite! I don't even know if I could bite! I'm not ignorant, that's  for sure. I know what I like, what I'm interested in and I will admit, I  have done my nervous research on my first how to's like kissing. It's  sad, but I'm so so so scared of my inexperience. How do I kiss? How do  people even make out? What's normal for a first date? What's it supposed  to feel like when you first kiss?

Also,  how do I go about confessing my inexperience to him? It was something  rather prominently disclaimed in my reddit post, but if he missed the  BDSM part, maybe he missed that as well? So how and when do I tell him?

TL;DR:  I'm a 100% virgin and have never even kissed though I've been talking a  big game with this guy (for almost a month) I hope is genuinely  interested in a relationship. How do I tell him but also not make a  complete fool of myself due to my inexperience?",relationships
"Hi all,

Often during intimate moments/closeness with my boyfriend (27/M) I get so self conscious that I start laughing. Sometimes it is just physical touch, e.g. when he puts his arm around my chest I get very conscious of my breathing and cannot relax. But also sometimes when he starts a conversation about something that requires my full attention to follow and he looks at me for a response.

I  have had this for about 1.5 years now and have slowly given up on the hope that it will just go away with time... We can talk about it really well and he doesn’t judge me for it. I don’t feel like he is “giving” me this feeling. It is rather something inside myself that shows up now because this is my first long-term love relationship (we’ve been together for 2.5 years). It is a feeling of being fully seen/felt/heard, which I guess scares me. Fighting it or trying to push it away only makes it worse because that makes me feel more cramped.

I haven’t been able to find something on the internet about it, so I hope to get some useful input this way! Can anyone relate to this? Is there a name for it? How do you cope?

TL;DR: Can anyway relate to nervous laughing during intimate moments/closeness with their partner?",relationships
"My girlfriend and I (19m) have been dating for nearly 3 years now and we’ve been friends since we were little and our relationship is great and I can honestly say she’s my best friend and that I can see myself marrying her in the future. But there’s just one problem, her dad doesn’t like me and is incredibly unstable and crazy and could ruin our relationship. 

From what my girlfriend has told me he has hit her, her mum, her younger brother (not sure much her younger sister) and has just recently hit her after she defended her brother for being on the computer and watching fortnite videos, he was also drunk and had downed a full body of vodka. He’s also smashed her phone when he saw a message from me saying “I love you too”, this pissed him so much he grabbed his son and told him to direct him to my house because he’d never been there before. I was at the gym and I get a call from my girlfriend crying and the next thing I know I get her mum telling me not to answer the door. I tell my older brother who was at home at the time not to answer it. Eventually her dad got at the house and started banging on the door, he eventually left after no one answered. One time when me and her were studying at the library he calls and asks where she is, this is what I heard, “what the fuck I didn’t know you were with me, fucking cunt”. A lot to take in I know. Whenever we’ve been together he’s seemed pretty civil but that could just be because his wife would be with him and probably told him to be nice. When it was her 18th she invited me and my parents to come and when we did everything seemed nice and I was really relieved. When we were saying goodbye he was so clearly drunk and hugging us goodbye and saying I’m so handsome etc. 

When my girlfriend recently told me he’d hit her I was pissed off and basically said I can’t marry you in the future if your dad continues to act like this as it could potentially put my family in danger as he now knows where I live and if my mum had answered the door when he came and he came and started swearing at her I would of lost my shit. I honestly don’t know what to do, should I break up with her and lose the person I love and care about the most due to her dad or do I continue to date her and if something else happens do I call it off? 

TL;DR- my girlfriends dad is crazy and doesn’t like me for no reason and could potentially lead us to breaking up as I fear what would happen if snapped in front of my parents and other family members. Should I end it with her and lose everything or stay and if something else happens then do I break it off?",relationships
"So I was  the first one to message him here on Reddit ..At first  he seemed  interested  and asked me for my fb after like 2 days but I wanted  to stay anonymous and said No. He used to text me back after 3 days or so and once he said that he would be more responsive if I was his fb friend and asked for my fb again .I was  hesitant  first but ended up adding him on my fb ( after  2 months)....after that he has been unresponsive for almost a week(and I see that he is often online )

Honestly I am average looking girl( I hate to brag but I am often told that I am cute )and  I do not have any body image issues.I am private person and do not share anything inappropriate on fb . Oh I forgot that I am not photogenic at all :)

Unfortunately  I do not know much about healthy relationships and sometimes my friends tell me that I should be more understanding and less  strict  when dealing with guys in general

So here is my question:

I did not have a crush or something on him but I can't help feeling a bit weird,insecure and angry.

( I know that there are many guys out there but what makes me feel sad is the fact that somehow I always end up meeting people  who make me feel weird and doubt myself)

Am I overreacting or are my feelings  valid ?

She then asks me to go get water with her and she just breaks down saying how she doesn't understand why he treats like that and why is it so hard for my dad to give her a proper happy mother's day.

"TL:DR are there any ideas for how we might compromise?

I have been with my partner for 2.5 years, and issues around my partner's allergies and my dog have been persistent. We have recently been discussing cohabitation (it's own slew of flags and issues) but the biggest hurdle we face is that I cannot sleep soundly or well if my dog is not in the room. He does not need to be in the bed, and he is not a registered service animal; but I do emotionally depend on him and got him to help me with my anxiety and ADHD. I have had my dog for 8 years and he has ALWAYS slept in the bed with me, unless my partner was staying OR the dog and I were at my partner's place (a very new development in trying to work it out).

My partner and I have tried a variety of troubleshoots to make it work:
- putting the dog to bed in the kitchen (an hour long process nightly in which I lay on the kitchen floor until the dog falls asleep and I sneak off) 
  - the dog either wakes and gets irritated 
  - I wake stressed and having not slept well
  - inevitably, I lose between 3-5 hours of sleep because the dog needs to be taken out or tended to (the dog can sleep as long as I do otherwise)
- me sleeping in the guest room with the dog
- me sleeping in the living room with the dog

All of these pose obvious issues. 

I have asked my partner if we could try sleeping with the dog on his own bed (which the dog loves) with our high-end allergen air purifiers (we each have one at our respective homes) as a compromise, because I'm out of ideas. It has been a HARD no; never going to happen. My partner is unwilling to even try it for a night (which was not the same answer a year in when it was first brought it up as an option...) 

Halp. Ideas? Or I'm afraid it might be the death of us...",relationships
"Hi! I'm a long time lurker and a first time poster so please let me know if I need to add anymore information and I'm sorry if it's too long!!

My boyfriend and I have been dating since 2016. We met at college and hit it off right away. We have the same sense of humor and are just really good friends. We started dating right when we met in our final years of college and I moved in with him after graduating. We have been living together for two years.

Whenever we fought in college, it was usually petty things. Insecurities, rumors, and dumb college kid fights. Once we were living together things got better. The only time we really fought was just stupid drunken fights and we were fine the next morning.

Recently, I've decided that I want to buy my first home in hopes of flipping it and paying off my student debt. I let my boyfriend know my plans and offered him half if he wanted to invest in a home with me. I put no pressure on him because it was my plan and I understand if he wasn't ready to buy a home. He said he wasn't ready but he would pay half of the mortgage and whatever else I needed as he would be my tenant and renting from me.

Well, we are now quarantined together in our rented home and we've been getting into more fights. Of course, this is going to happen because only seeing the same person for months does get frustrating. But these fights seemed to be more ""real."" Because I have made the decision to buy a home, I've been really looking at my life and what I want out of it. I've asked him what he wants and he always says he doesn't know. Right now he's just working on his career and figuring out if that's what he wants to do for the rest of his life. Okay, cool. Then I asked about our relationship and what are the plans for that. He says he loves me a lot and wants to be with me but he just isn't financially ready to get married. I told him I wasn't worried about that because I wasn't ready either, I just wanted to make sure we were going in the same direction.

We both then laid everything out on the table of what could be holding us back. My biggest concern in our relationship, he doesn't put in any effort. He's never technically asked me on a real date. The only times we go on dates are anniversaries, holidays, and birthdays. I feel like he doesn't put much thought into what he could do to make me happy. His biggest concern is that he just doesn't want to.

Of course this was upsetting to hear, we were both pretty bummed about this but eventually we moved on and seemed to be normal again. Then last night happened. We were hanging out after a really great day. We were giggling all day and chasing each other around the house and just generally having a blast. As we were hanging out on the couch, I was looking at our horoscopes for fun. I read it out loud, not proofreading it first, and the last sentence said ""ask about marriage."" So we started talking about it. He said his usually he's not ready for it financially and it's expensive but then he brought up that there is a 50% divorce rate and he doesn't think marriage in general is much different than dating. I got upset because after such a great day, it was kind of a downer to talk this way about marriage. I know I'm sensitive so I got a little sad, but didn't say anything. He then brought up the fact that a few weeks ago, when I was out of town and helping my mom move during this pandemic, he felt like a weight was lifted off his shoulders and he was happy to be alone. Now, that's when I said something. Of course I got upset because I thought this was a very rude thing to say to someone, no matter how true it is. I stormed out of the house and went for a drive. After about two hours I came home and we talked. We were both upset but we came to the general consensus that maybe we're just not working anymore. And we both love each other a lot, but we have different views when it comes to relationships. I like someone to be a partner and he's more independent. To top it all off, it's our four year anniversary this week so all the presents I had planned for him are coming in.

We are separate but still in the same home. I love him so much. We share two cats together, one I saved by myself in college and the other we got together at a shelter. And since we've lived together since college, a lot of our things are split 50/50. I don't really know what to do in this situation and any advice would be helpful. Thanks.

tl;dr My boyfriend and I have been together since college and have very different views on relationships. I want a partner, he likes his independence. Now we're quarantined and going through what seems to be a breakup. What do I do?",relationships
"Tl;dr: Title

So, over night my gf's bird (more simple) died, she did her best in order to help him in the weeks before, she did not have him since his birth/when he was a few months old, she had him for a year now I think, we both had a talk about it a few days ago, and we came to the conclusion, that the ""shop"" where she got him, gave her illegally a sick bird.

She obviously wasn't able to bring him to a doctor during this pandemic (her parents are taking this very seriously, a bit too much imo, but that's not the topic + it is a fairly new race), but she did do her best in order to nurse him.

I of course wrote her a text (she is in schoo rn) saying that she did the best one could do in order to nurse him, and that he certainly was very thankful towards her (I really think that) and that she is the best caretaker he could have had and that certainly not everyone would have nursed him to that huge extent. I closed the text with saying that's what I love about her too, that she is so supporting etc. (ah, german to english haha) and the best person in the unverse and that I love her so much and that the bird certainly did, too.

We are in a LDR (even before the pandemic), so I cannot just ""drop by"" of course, but is there any other way I can support her right now?

Thanks in advance :)",relationships
"Hello, I will try to keep this short. 

My GF has been struggling with anxiety her whole life. She grew up in a traumatic environment and I knew that she was working through years of pent up anger when we first started dating. 

The years have been more or less the same, but I am seeing that I am getting shorter and shorter with her because I am more or less annoyed that the patterns never seem to change. 

She has been seeking counseling for the last 1.5 years, off and on, but the work seems to be getting her nowhere. She still cannot cope and proactively work on her anxiety. She has found a new counselor and will be starting EMDR therapy shortly and I hope it gets at some of her deep rooted trauma induced anxieties. 

One of the things I always said about this relationship was that I wanted to see her make her dreams a reality. That meant finding a full time job that fit her desires, but the fear of pursuing such a job makes her curl up and fall apart. She falls apart when it comes to pretty much everything (e.g. making a phone call to order pizza, opening bills...)

I know she is struggling and I have been as supportive as I can, but I am beginning to think those thoughts. Do I leave? I need some time for me when it seems all my energy is focused on making her environment as stress free as possible. 

So how do I deal with this? I love her and I want to see her battle this anxious beast inside of her, but I don't see her making real efforts to get better (e.g. practicing deescalating techniques, working out to relieve stress...)

Any advice for a struggling partner that I fearing the only option is to more or less get out of this relationship, which I don't want.

"My girlfriend went backpacking on the other side of the globe during Christmas and new years to go hostel hopping with strangers and spend quality time with people she doesn't know. I was vehemently against this. I was unable to go due to classes; she had a break and decided to go alone.  she didnt visit me but instead chose to travel abroad. spending 6 weeks abroad.  


upon going to New Zealand i noticed how she was always saying how horny she is and what not. i felt that was out of character for her because she doesn't talk like that to me ... despite we live in different cities.. she then went to a concert with a bunch of hostel people; didn't text me for nearly 30 hours. and then told me she didn't drunk but everyone else did and she didn't like. then she went to the beach with some of her new hostel friends. at the beach she was wearing a very skimpy outfit (which i later found out due to photos taken) much to my surprise; i didn't think she'd dress that was in front of those guys when she had a bf... not to mention she spent the entire day swimming and playing water sports with that group.   


she kept talking about another American guy she met there who was talking to her friend. She wanted to travel to a different city but did not want to take the bus, she said she playfully said to him oh maybe you can drive us there since your also going there (he was going a few days later, and rented a car) so he decided to go earlier and drive her and her friend there on a several hour trip. once they got there she was also minimally texting according to the photos they took in the car she was sitting in the back seat while her friend sat in the front seat. she said they sang songs and had a lot of fun. how fun..... so the guy then decided to stay at the same hostel as them for the night and the next day they traveled some more and day after as well...... so on the night before his flight back to the US; she and him stayed up all night ""talking"" in the hostel lounge room; her travel buddy friend decided to leave because she was  feeling tired/ill... so it was just the two of them in the lounge room; playing pool; rather he was teaching her how to play pool; and it was ""a lot of fun"".  


 then the lounge area was empty they decided to go to the liquor store and buy some wine, mind you this is at 10-11 pm .. so she went with him for a long walk they talked for hours by now 5-6 hours at least; before the wine. so they got wine and went to a private room to drink and talk... in a room alone; just the two of them till 3am... while ignoring my texts during this period. in the morning (after another sleepless night) i called her and she picked up the phone her voice was totally different. my stomach churned... while  i called her; the guy came in to say good bye, i told her not to hang up the phone. she did not; apparently he gave her a hug and they said have a safe trip to each other. apparently she doesn't know his last name.. so i called her out im like what did you do that night she just said that she just talked to him i told her to call me on video camera. and she did. I said what did you do? she said i didnt do anything; we just talked.   


i told her her voice sounded different she said its because she was a bit hungover. and said shes sorry it was inappropriate of her to stay in that room with him alone; i said at the very least its emotional cheating... she then seemed to cry and said no; dont leave me i love you i dont want to lose you.. im like.. you promised me u wouldnt drink when u left. and then you drank with your travel buddies at dinner and then you got drunk. wtf. this wasnt new yers eve or christmas when that happened. so there isn't that excuse. she told me that she told that guy she has a bf and that i was worried about her travels alone backpacking alone. he said he must really love u. and he said how his mom died. and he decided to backpack around the world. and so she talked with him for hours about his mom... yeah right.. all night..  


 i know some guys who use bs stories like this to get sympathy for girls so they can get something else...... so according to her nothing happened they didn't kiss or hold hands. or anything more. but her voice was totally different her demeanor was different. prior to that day she kept saying how horny she was. and she sent me nudes; shes never done that before.i got a very sick to my stomach feeling. whats also strange is that she never told anyone else on her entire trip that she had a bf... when i asked her what she would say if someone did ask her; she said id tell them im interested in someone right now but we are living in different cities , its difficult but ill try to work it out. i said that sounds to me like ""hey convince me to leave him""  she also profusely professed her love to me before the trip and before this event and after; later she confessed she just said that because she loves me but also because she didnt want to lose me; and she was afraid she'd meet someoen and that love for me would fade; because she was on the other side of the world... she said she had doubts she'd change on her trip. whether she would change in her feelings for me. but according to her shse didn't.. WTF. ive also noticed how easy she was once she confessed she liked me. so i had flashbacks to that; if she was easy with me could she be that way anyone else? she did tell me that when she is single shes someone that ""easily falls for people""

anyway so due to this quarantine i havent been able to meet her; shes hardly replying to her texts; shes spending time with her family and almost ignoring me we are writing/texting maybe 10% or less of what we used to text; we havent seen eachother physically or on camera in over a month. i understand shes working taking care of an elderly family. and shes doing an internship but her professor is a very attractive guy who... lets just say has a reputation for flirting with his students. she says she doesnt like him; but her grade depends on him.. she spends time with her family why does she not spend time with me. all those bad thoughts from before come back into my head. what do you make of this situation? what do you think happened on her solo trip; do you believe she doesnt know that guys name? just writing about htis makes me a nervous wreck. plz help.  i will reply to any questions you have by adding to the post.

TLDR: gf solo traveled; acted extremely out of character; sent nudes talked about sex incessantly. something she never does; spent all night drinking ""wine""; got drunk (after promising not to drink) and talking to an attractive backpacker while ignoring my texts. the next day her voice inflections/tone were totally different. almost as if it was a different person. was extremely sexual on her trip. she told me on her trip that she said she loves me to make sure i dont leave her and she was afraid of meeting someone new and forgetting about me... something that she is not anymore. now shes always busy working and has hardly anytime for me. wondering what to do... she always says she loves me but. she is unavailable due to work/school or family. shes doing an internship with an extremely attractive professor. who flirts with his students; her grade depends on her. what do you think happened on her trip.. be brutally honest. and tell me how i can cross examine her to get the truth? thank you thank you thank you thank you!",relationships

Background info: he is a m22 and I’m a f21. Friends since middle school situation. We were incredibly close for about 6 years and for the past 3 years we were both in long term relationships. Funnily enough, both of our relationships have ended in the same time frame which is about 4 months ago more or less. 

One night about a month ago, we had talked for 6 hours and one thing led to another. Since then, every time I’ve felt sad and lonely or he has, we’d end up talking about it with a 50% chance of hooking up. I’ve been trying to figure out how to draw boundaries but everything I’ve read about rules for fwb is don’t go deep or depend on them emotionally. Don’t sleep over. Don’t make them more than sex. He’s one of my closest friends and I know I shouldn’t be sleeping with him but it’s really helped me since my breakup, as I’m sure it’s doing the same for him. Plus the sex is kind of amazing. Anyway, if anyone has experience with this, I’d really appreciate some help. 

I just don’t know what kind of lines to draw so I don’t develop feelings because if this goes on, I will end up falling for him. I’ve been cursed with having my heart in my vagina.

I've been in past relationships, 3 of them, lasting.. pretty long actually.. ive always gotten so attatched to people, yet.. in the end it drives them away
what can you say for someone so young as me? haha
point is.. i've never felt so strong for someone, missed someone so dearly.. 
I believe i love him, i really do
i want to be with him everyday.. but also have our lives and just.. live together in the future and shit
its quite a vague question, but..
is it dumb?
to hope to stay with the same person?
to love someone at such a young age..
this subreddit has so many rules..
im sure its gonna be taken down but, thanks to anyone who comments♡

Young 15 year old girl wants to know if its immature to believe she can stay with the same 15 year old guy for a long time",relationships
"Me and my girlfriend have only been together for a short time, a few months, but as of late I’ve started feeling incredibly overwhelmed by us being together. I’ll directly admit we’ve been breaking quarantine to see each other since we don’t really interact with anyone else, but because everything’s closed, all we do is hang out in my room watching tv and cuddling. That’s it... and I hate it. 

What made me feel close to her in the first place are the things we did together, like going to new restaurants or just checking out neat places, but of course that hasn’t been possible for the past several weeks. When I began feeling “off”, I just thought I was dealing with some lockdown-related depression and that was that. However, I realized there were moments where I felt much better. Specifically, when I wasn’t with my girlfriend.

I’m an incredibly introverted guy who needs a lot of time to recharge after socializing, but the thing is, my girlfriend wants to spend so much time together that I’ve actually had less time to myself since the lockdown’s started. Eventually I told my girlfriend that I needed a bit more time alone to recharge, but since saying that, she’s been asking to hang out even more, which brings me to yesterday. I DEMANDED not to see her as much as a boundary and think she’ll respect that, but I just need to vent this whole thing out. 

Today was the first full day I’ve had to myself in months (besides spending time with my family for Mother’s Day) and it’s been the nicest day I’ve had this whole quarantine. Since I feel like I’m able to think clearly for the first time in a while, I’m wondering if I could get any feedback on how to work things out with my girlfriend. Again, I don’t even know if it’s her or the lockdown making me feel so drained (or even a mix of both). Even hearing if anyone can relate would be awesome. 

Glad I had a chance to get this off my chest, and thank you for reading.

TL;DR: I’m feeling burnt out from how often my girlfriend wants to hang out, but don’t know if she’s the one making me feel so drained or the lockdown itself.",relationships
"so I ( 18 M ) met this really amazing person ( ONLINE ), now i am straight, i notice that they \*obviously\* were flirting with me, and i was just blind for the longest time, so things happen, we talk in DMs, and i ask about their gender cause... i really had no clue, i would've assumed it was a girl.  
He tells me that he is going trans, and i didn't wanna sound like an asshole and ruin any friendship between us, so i moved along with it, and now here we are, we talk everyday, so i ask what's up with the surgery, and he says his family doesn't really support him nor want him to do the surgery.  
Now....

"I recently made a new friend group at my university, we all hangout/go out together over the weekends etc. I met this really sweet girl and instantly started to crush on her, we both briefly spoke with one another for the past few weeks and last weekend when we finally started to be intimate. we were kissing and I told her my feelings for her and she said she felt the same way &amp; we both agreed to take things slow. 

I’m looking for advice on how I approach this now(as the past 6-8 months I have been loving the single life)  should I slowly start to try and hangout/speak with her more and more and see where things go. I’m just a little lost and nervous. 

Any advice will be appreciated ❤️

"tl;dr: My friend has a crush on me. I really like her but I'm not so attracted to her. Should I still try dating her?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend (whom I will call A) who has a crush on me. I think she's great too, and in the past I've thought about trying a relationship with her. But, I'm not as attracted to her as I would like.

I'm pretty new to sex and relationships in general, so I'm hoping someone could help me decide what to do. 

When I think of having sex with A, I imagine the loving kind of sex that you have to feel close to someone. However, I have a friend-with-benefits of a few months (B), and when I have sex with B it's the more lustful kind of sex that you do because you're horny, if that makes sense. I can't really see myself having that kind of sex with A.

This makes me kind of worried about starting a relationship with A. I think I would want someone who makes me feel the intense lustful attraction like I've felt with B. I think if A had a relationship with me she would want to be able to make me feel that way, too. I don't think A has the greatest self image, and I am extremely worried about hurting her feelings or making her insecure as a result of trying to have a relationship with her. I'm wondering if it would just be better to tell her I'm not interested now.

At the same time, I really do want a relationship with A. I care about her so much. I want to hold her and make her feel happy. She's the best person I know. It seems like such bullshit that physical attraction should be the reason that I don't do that. But I always hear that attraction is really important to a relationship. It doesn't seem fair.

It's really hard for me to decide what to do. One part of me thinks that I should just try to have a relationship with A, and if it doesn't work, well, that's how it goes sometimes. But the other part of me is very worried about hurting her, not to mention that she's one of my best friends and I would hate to lose her. It doesn't help that I can't see anyone in person right now because of the pandemic.

Those of you who've been in a situation like this, or others with experience, what do you think I should do? How can I decide? Thanks.",relationships

tl;dr: I confronted my boyfriend (2 year relationship) about him treating me badly while having feelings for his coworker and spending a lot of time with her, and he told me that I was making it all up and needed therapy, even though I found evidence he hid from me.

Last month I came across some information that my boyfriend had feelings for his coworker. For the past few months of the relationship, he was treating me like trash.

He would criticize me for everything I did around the house no matter what it was and snap at everything I said. He always tries to change the way I do things, even though I have been living alone and doing things on my own for way longer than he has. At one point he threw a cardboard box at me because I forgot to throw it out. He would get angry at me for being out late (like 9PM by his definition) and would message me every hour asking me when I'm coming home, he would tell me to stop talking about what's on my mind because it's too much for him to handle because of 'work', and so I shut myself down and ended up talking to my friends instead about what's really going on with me. Now they know way more about my inner world than my boyfriend ever will. He kept on threatening to break up with me because I wasn't taking care of the home according to his 'rules' and he made jokes about putting up with me until the lease finished.

He got really angry at me when I came home at 11 on a Saturday one time, even though he said he didn't have an issue with me being out late on weekends, and then set a curfew.

I haven't had a night out or a fun time with friends since I entered this relationship, and I can't relax when I am away from him because he won't stop messaging me about when I'm coming home, really limiting my social life and freedom.

When all this was really stressing me out and making me miserable, I wanted to know what I was doing that was so wrong, because I followed his rules, and I stopped talking as much around him, and he wouldn't stop treating me horribly. So I finally took up the courage to check his laptop when he was out to find some of his notes. In his notes he wrote:

""I can't help my attraction to Sara (his coworker) and it makes me doubt Jess (me). I can't be guilty of the same things that made my last girlfriend leave me""

It took me a while to confront him about this, since I felt bad about snooping but I felt worse about how he was treating me as well. He made me feel so unsafe, to the point where I would work overtime back before the virus so I could avoid being at home.

I finally confronted him (without telling him about the snooping) and he told me I was making everything up and that I should go get therapy.

Now that everything is on lockdown the tensions have eased and I think it's because I am home all the time and I have nowhere to go. Usually he would message me immediately after work to ask when I'd be home, and if I was going out, he'd be messaging every 30 minutes or hour after that, asking the same question. Now that I am stuck at home and there is no where to go out, those stressors aren't happening anymore.

He has been acting much nicer and kinder lately, but I can't stop thinking about how he gaslit me and how cruel and controlling he was before.

He now asking me why I am guarded and haven't been initiating sex. If I tell him the truth, I guarantee he will say it's because I'm 'crazy' again rather than telling me the truth. I can't have sex with someone who first made me feel unsafe in my relationship, then gaslit me to hide his feelings for someone else. I still don't feel entirely safe around him after seeing how cruel he can actually be and now that I know he willingly gaslit me for his own selfish reasons.

I feel extremely trapped, suffocated and manipulated and I  don't have the money or the means to leave. What scares me the most is I feel like the pandemic restrictions have neutralized everything, so it's like the rest of the world is living by the same rules he originally set for me before the virus started.

How do I handle this?",relationships
"Here's my conundrum: I (21F) am in a committed relationship with a guy (22M). Have been for about a year. About a week into our relationship, I went out with some friends and gut super drunk. One of my friends (22F) was also super drunk and we were accompanying each other to the bathroom, when she said that she'd never kissed a girl and kind of wanted to. Neither of us are gay, and she has a fiancé. I was like, ""sure, why the hell not, haha."" We then did a fast peck on the lips and moved on with our lives after some giggles. There was no open mouth or anything. There was no sexual interest involved, at least not on my part, and it didn't even occur to me at the time that that could count as cheating.

Anyway, I was talking to my bf the other day and something along those lines came up, and I remembered that and he said that he wouldn't want to see me making out with another girl. He compared me kissing another girl to him getting a blowjob from another guy, which I don't quite agree with. I hadn't even thought of it until our conversation. There was no pleasure in it other than a drunken giggle. I'm very against cheating. I've been cheated on, and it **sucks**. And now I'm feeling guilty and hating myself because a friendly close-mouthed peck on the lips with someone of someone who is strictly a friend.

Help?

TL;DR: At the very beginning of my relationship (M/F), I gave my friend (F) a drunken peck on the lips, and there was no sexual interest involved. Now, almost a year later, me and my bf were talking and I remembered that. Now I feel guilty, because it didn't occur to me that that could be cheating.",relationships
"I met my boyfriend last summer through mutual friends and we got along great, same humor and clicked really well. After about three months of dating he moved into my apartment and everything was smooth sailing, we spent a lot of time together, enjoyed different types of content together, had a lot of sex, everything was perfect. 

I know that he's depressed because we talked about it when we just started getting to know each other, so am I, but everything was going well living together, the apartment was clean for about a month... 

Fast forward from a month until now almost a year later. He doesn't clean unless you tell him to, and even then he doesn't do it or it takes him about a week. He doesn't do anything other than sit at his computer all day and I get barely any attention, both romantic, as a friend and sexual.

My appearance hasn't changed since we started dating so it's not that he's no longer attracted to me, I'm sure he loves me and the way I look but the attention I received in those first three months is basically completely gone. I don't think he's cheating since he always stays at home and is only on his computer playing games all day, all night, so I doubt that it's even possible. He gives me compliments about my appearance regularly and it sounds genuine so I don't think that's the problem either.

We don't spend much time together, and I have told him several times that I want to. I suggest different things that we could do but the response is always ""I don't feel like doing that."" and if I ask him what he wants to do he just says that there's nothing that he wants to do.

I can't really get him to spend time with me and it's really starting to wear on me.

I tried indulging in the games he likes to play but he doesn't seem to enjoy his time when we play together, yet he likes playing co-op with his friends..

I have a really hard time getting started with things like cleaning, or even playing a game, but for things like household chores I ask my parents for help if I feel like I can't handle it. He knows that he can't handle the chores, yet he doesn't do anything or ask anyone for help with them and tries to tell me that most of the dishes are mine, he didn't really clutter etc. when I already cleaned up my part of the mess. A lot of the time I do his part of the chores since otherwise they never happen. Sometimes I've let his part of the household just be and watch as the mess accumulates and if I say nothing he will do absolutely nothing. The fact that the dishes smell is the worst part, especially when they've been there for 2 weeks.

I make a decent amount of money, a lot more than he does, we live comfortably. Every time we go to the grocery store he points out how expensive the things I'm looking at are (chips, bread, hot dogs, you name it) and tells me several times ""Oh that is so expensive!"" which in turn makes me feel bad and ashamed of the things I want to buy and normally would buy with **my own** money. 

He did grow up in a lower class family but they were not poor, so I find these comments really unnecessary since I can afford it, I want it and thus I will buy it. He tells me that's just his opinion. He always has money for cigarettes though.

Three months ago I sat him down and told him that I feel like his mother and I don't want that to be our relationship. Previously to this I've talked to him about many problems but it's been more soft spoken, though still serious. Me having to do everything and making sure anything happens is too much for me and I need him to step up and do something about it or ask his parents for help. He seemed really understanding, repeated back the problems to me and said that he is going to do something about it and that he needs to act like an adult already.

A month passes and everything is as it's been for many months which is me doing everything, nagging him about everything with no or few results. I had a few more serious talks where I told him that I am serious and if he can't help with anything then he needs to move out. A little while later I ended up telling him that you need to move out now, I can't take care of an adult man like this. He sweet talked me into letting him stay, that he really is going to change this time and he loves me so much! He promised, and he actually delivered. He cleans now, not as much as I'd like but it is so much better than before. 

Thing is, now I'm resentful for how he treated me previously. I feel disrespected because all along he COULD clean but he didn't. He listened to me through all the serious talks but he chose not to do anything about it until I was kicking him out, even though I had told him several times before that I was serious then too. He used to blame everything on his ADHD, that's why he couldn't do anything. It feels like he didn't care enough about my stress and feelings up until he realized shit hit the fan. Though, it doesn't feel like he really cares about that now either, but that he wants to stay living in my apartment because it's comfortable and he likes me.

Now that he's actually trying I don't know if I'm being unreasonable by being angry still, not being able to let go of the fact that he was capable this entire time.

Sex is still rare and the same thing goes for spending time together, and I've talked to him several times about these things as well and it seems like he takes it seriously but then absolutely nothing happens.

He's depressed, which of course can and is contributing to these behaviors but it's his attitude and the way he ignores everything as his way to cope, that really isn't working for me. He tells me that there is nothing he can do because he is just too depressed, but he has more energy for games than I do for anything. He meets a therapist every now and then and is on SSRIs as well.

All of the problems above I've talked about many times with him and tried to work out a solution so he is definitely aware of everything. 

Am I an asshole for still being upset at him? I try to treat and judge him by his recent actions but some days I feel so lonely and hurt and I don't know what to do with these feelings.

What can I do at this point? I care for him and I do love him but my feelings are hurt and I push them away because of it. I'm not sure if I can do anything.

tl;dr: My boyfriend claimed for almost a year that he couldn't clean because of his ADHD and now he suddenly can when I was about to kick him out.",relationships
"Hello,

I know how the title sounds. Please listen to the story, I hope you will find me reasonable. Bf and I were exclusive sexually from the beginning (Dec2018). We got kind of serious emotionally around July 2019. Ten months into knowing him (in Sep 2019) and his family and spending a lot of time with him, through conversation, he told me he has had sex with his best friend (call her J), 2-3 years ago. They had casual sex for about a year, then he stopped because he sensed she wanted more, and since then they have been strictly friends. She moved away in Dec 2018 but she visited every now and then.

All good, except that he hid it from me on purpose for ten whole months. During these months, she came to live with him, in his apartment, for about a month (in March 2019) , and few weeks here and there. I never got to meet her. We weren't ""together"" officially then so I didn't even think much about it. However when he told me, it just felt like a slap on the face. It's not like she wasn't talked about. He chose to hide things until I asked him directly. Furthermore, he was always regularly texting him, apparently she tells him all the intimate details of her life.  He said they are strictly friends, and I chose to try to understand it.

Very well, after this incident he even told her about me. Anyways, the hiding made me kind of insecure, about him, her and their relationship. In the next six months that followed, me and bf had a lot friction over his communication with her and J in this time got a boyfriend, got herpes, got pregnant, got an abortion, had fights with the boyfriends, and broke up with the boyfriend.

In April I got to know that apparently she was in love with him. They stopped having sex because she had a foursome with three other guys, felt guilty, told bf and implied she wanted relationship, bf said it's better to part ways. Remained friends. At some point, bf thought it's better to stop talking to her, and said so. She popped pills and tried to kill herself because he is 'too important for her'. He had to call her neighbors (in her home country where she was) to take her to the hospital and save her life. All of these details bf was still hiding from me until April.

In april, we talked about it again, and I said that I don't trust him anymore (in the last few months he was hiding it when she called him and so on; instead of being completely honest like a normal person). I told him, I am not happy with this, I will either learn to live with it or I will get fed up and leave. He said ""what do you want me to do? Please tell me I will do it I promise"". I didn't want him to do anything just for me, but I said you might have to stop talking to her. He said okay. He stopped talking to her and told her the reasons why. She was pissed.Not five days later, I saw his phone and I hate to admit it but I looked at his messenger screen, there were unread messages from her. I asked him if she has texted him, he said NO right away to my face. I told him I saw her name lit up on the screen, please stop lying. Then he broke down and said that he got to know from a friend that she visited a doctor and she found out that she has BPD and her bf dumped her, he just wanted to know that she is okay. He wanted a second chance. I took some time to think, and hm idk what was the right thing to do. In this week she texted him ""I tried to kill myself today, life's too hard"" to which bf didn't reply and told me. After ten days or so, I said okay let's try. However fucked up the situation might be, ultimately, he is trying to look out for a friend, it's not like he is cheating on me.

He said that his relationship with J has not been healthy, and he is choosing to not talk to her anymore. I told him to not do that just because of me, I don't like that. He said that he is making his choice and bla bla bla. She kept texting him even though he wasn't responding, giving him ""updates"" of her life, she is quitting her job in the UK and moving back home to 'focus on herself'. I think she has been very manipulative to him, and he is been enabling of her behavior. Anyways I digress. Her little updates, which the bf told me about, were not doing my bad mental state any favor, we had a fight again and bf asked me what to do and I asked to have her blocked, and he did.

In the last month, we have not been that good. I slip up, and he has been cranky about things. He doesn't like that fact that everything bad that he did (lying and hiding) is always there. If I question him about something (I have been careful about it, about letting my bad mental state affect him) it makes him feel like a bad guy and he is tired of feeling that way and that I am not understanding. Yesterday we were talking about something, and he said that I ""forced"" him to not talk to her. Our recovery from his hiding and lying hasn't been smooth. Nothing since September has been smooth. Trust is broken, and I don't want to be with someone I have to force. I was very clear when I said that hey ""X is hurting me. I will either get used to it or we will break up"", he asked me what'd I want him to do. I told him, he chose to do it. But now apparently it's hanging over my head, as something I forced him to do. I hate it. What'd the best way to navigate this situation? How do I tell him that I don't want him to be with me if he feels this way? I have tried using these words, he just laughs and says that I obviously made him choose between his friend or me and for a lot of people it's norm to be in such a relationship with people they had sex with, or even their exs. I don't agree with this.

Is there hope in trying to have a future with this man? Or our differing pov are too big an incompatibility.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: bf has been long term friends with his ex-fwb, who I find very manipulative, and who I have never met. I didn't want to be with him while has such a close relationship with her. He chose to not talk to her, and now he says that I forced him to do that. What do I do here? Can I talk to him in a way that makes us understand each other?",relationships

"I'm an expat in the Asian country I'm currently living in. I moved here in May 2019. Shortly after I arrived, I started dating a girl who I was crazy about (let's call her A). We had a lot of common interests and very similar values in relationships. It was honestly the most healthy and positive relationship I've ever had.

Thing is, she was only visiting home for the summer because she goes to college in New York. We agreed to call things off in September when she returned to the US, but ended up keeping in touch for a few months afterwards. We wanted to stay together so we talked about me moving to NYC (yes I know, it was too soon), but ultimately I couldn't afford it, and US visas are tough to get regardless.

Not knowing when we'd see each other again, we agreed it wasn't very logical to keep dating, said ""I love you"" and wished each other well. I missed her terribly afterwards, and it took me quite a while to feel better.  
Cut to March 2020 - I was mostly healed and met another girl, B, on Tinder. She's sweet and I like her very much. We've been hanging out a lot since then. It's been mostly great, save for a few problems with boundaries. I asked her to take it slow in the beginning but she hasn't really been keen on that - I wanted to wait to have sex, but she kept trying to seduce me on our second date and I caved. She told me she loved me in the first two weeks and it made me feel uneasy. She told me she understood that I couldn't say it back, but was waiting to hear it.

A mere two weeks after my first date with B I receive a text from A, saying she's back in town due to the virus. I was ecstatic, but immediately filled with confusion and guilt. I don't want to hurt B, or jump too quickly from what is mostly a good relationship.  
In April I admitted the situation to B, and explained that it was making me confused and depressed. B asked me if I was still in love with A, and I couldn't think of anything to say (I was just quiet, because I couldn't honestly say no). I was expecting her to leave me, but she didn't. We've been hanging out still but I've been thinking about A this whole time, and it feels unfair to B.

I've talked to A a few times on the phone, but haven't met up in person yet. She'll be in the country until December, and so will I. I have no clue if getting back together is a good idea, because she will likely go back to NYC at least until she graduates in May 2021. I feel like a total asshole about all this and I hate the idea of breaking anyone's heart. I can't help but feel a little distant from B and I think I'm being unfair to her thinking about another girl this whole time.

"I\[19/M\], have been with my GF\[19/F\] for about 2 years now and 1 thing that bugs me is that she always thinks that I don't miss her just because I don't text her as frequently as she likes. She would feel sad that I don't miss her and harbor thoughts that I just don't care about her and it makes her sad. This is despite the fact that I do text her and that I just really have nothing to talk to her about. Because of the current situation we cant physically meet and we've been texting and calling a lot. Is it right for me to say that she is emotionally dependent on me because I always have to be the one to cheer her up, or is it that it's my fault that I'm not caring enough that causes her to feel this way?

"I (22M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been together currently for nearly 5 months, we were together once before but broke things off because of her mother getting in the way. We've dated mostly on for the past 2 years. When I met her was when I started college in fall of 2016. At the time she dated someone else, but after a year and a half they broke up and I decided to spend time with her as a friend.

After spending time with her during that summer we began having feelings for each other, and it was also where I learned that her mother was abusive towards her. She had complained about her mother before but I wasn't sure if it was the typical family issues or very serious until I saw it myself. After this I checked in on her and planned events to see her at like the state Fair, so I could comfort her and make sure she was ok. 

Proceed to the following autumn semester and I asked her out. We ended up being together, obviously her mother's abuse and trying to keep her daughter from contacting too many people including myself cut into and hurt our relationship. We ended on bad terms, however I still cared for her and checked on her trying to give her comfort as best I could considering she had her mother ruining her life. 

Fast forward to October of last year, when I took her to a local festival along with my mom and friend. Her mother called and threatened her life over the phone, knowing I couldn't let her go back to that house I took her home and had the police help try to help us get some of her things from her mother's house. We were unable to recover items that night but she knew that she wasn't tied down to her mother anymore. 

So my family and I made up a place for her to sleep, I got her a job at my work place and was helping her pay off her student debt. Helping her be able to move forward in life and away from her mother. She was happy to have a job something she could never do under her mother's thumb.  

Months later she questioned getting back into contact with her father, I encouraged her to do so to see if any he was better than how she remembered since he left when she was 14. We got her in contact with him and she was delighted to have her dad back in her life, and so was he. Thankful I got her free from her abusive mother and putting her back in touch with him, less than a month later he convinces her to move in with him and his new family. Giving her a room of her own.

Not long afterwards I found out he has been complaining about me and telling her to break up with me, telling her I am worthless since I don't have a car, my own place and a job in my degree field that she should leave me. Telling her to cut off all contact with me, going so far as to check her phone if she talks to me and if she has her door room closed. I'm worried that she will listen to him and end it with me, she's already fell into agreeing with him on blaming me for not having her a car yet. I suffer from depression and have been clingy, issues I acknowledge and have worked on.

I don't want to make myself out to be a perfect person at all, I know I have my flaws. But it's put me in a position of wondering if I should stay in the relationship hoping she'll see past want her dad says and is happy for all the things I have done for her or that she'll leave me and think of me the same way her father does. She's always had problems rebelling against her family when she knows they are wrong, obviously because of abuse and neglect.

What I want to ask of the people here, do I stick through it or should I give up and accept the loss? And if I stick through it, what should I do from here on?

Tl;Dr my girlfriend's mother abused her and she has been set free from her grasp. Now her father who was gone for seven years is trying to get her to end it with me after all I have worked on with her and for her. Should I stay or just end it?",relationships
"when we started texting, i was initially excited. she was nice. genuinely interested. so she called me and i called her back. talking about moving to australia and how she got a pot tattoo on her vag while drunk. talking about how we all just need to “save the world” instead of the economy and how she doesn’t wear masks in this pandemic because it’s bad for “the earth”. complaining i don’t remember stuff from 5+ years back. uhh, yeah, sorry i’ve had a stressful life for 5 years. she’s no job, living with mom still. wow, 100 to 0 real quick. certified hippie cringe poser.

"Me- 20M
Mom- 45F
Sister- 18-F
Length of relationship w/ mom- 20 years.

My mom always seems to shut me down in conversations when I talk. It doesn’t happen all the time but it’s enough to notice and get annoyed by it. She is not a strict mother but she is firm and will hold her stance when she needs to be. My dad is also out of of the picture for more context. 

So we’ll have a conversation about anything and if I say anything that she disagrees with or if I disagree with her on ANYTHING, she’ll usually get a little defensive and try to counter what I said with something else and we won’t be arguing or even almost fighting but we’re just talking but we just have a disagreement but after 1 or 2 more responses she’ll just shut the conversation down and say I don’t want to talk about this Or something like that. 

I get kind of stunned because I can’t tell her, no you have to talk about it with me. So I end up just not saying anything and it gets kind of awkward because she doesn’t say anything either after that.

It can be anything that we talk about too because today we watched lighthouse and she had mixed feelings about it because she got confused with the ending and when I told her that I can show her something on reddit that can  explain the ending and make it make sense, she shut it down immediately and said no I don’t want someone’s opinion on it. I tried to clarify and she just said no I don’t want to talk about it. And it got awkward again. 

I don’t know why she does this because she always goes to talk to my sister and seems super interested in whatever they talk about but when I try to talk to her about stuff I’m interested in she always just shuts me down. It feels like she isn’t interested in what I have to say.

TLDR: when I talk to my mom about stuff it seems like she doesn’t care what I have to say because she shuts me down mid-conversation, why?",relationships
"Just broke up with my partner. Our relationship was mostly good, no real fighting, lots of laughter etc. but I also felt like she wasn’t interested in the same type of things as me. She was a different type of person, into fitness and romcoms, while I am more into music and photography and reading. Despite our differences, I loved her for her innocent and very pure love. I truely believe she was an amazingly kind hearted and innocent person, and I feel honestly terrible about hurting her. I broke up with her slightly out of the blue, although we both acknowledged the last month or so had been a lull. She was mad I didn’t try fix a broken spirit, to bring back our spark. I suppose i just need reassurance I’ve done the right thing. Before this, I had (without her knowledge) been through periods of unhappiness in our relationship as I just didn’t see a future in us, however now seeing her so heartbroken and hurt has made me think I may have simply got hung up on our differences and forgotten our likenesses. Please someone talk with me about this, I have friends but I don’t feel comfortable talking with them about this at the moment. I just need a chat

"My (17F) boyfriend (17M) of 8 months often says things that are mean to me but I don’t think he does it to hurt my feelings. When we first started dating there was a girl that I used to be friends and he implied that she was “hotter” than me. I was hurt by the fact that he would say this but I let it go in case he just worded things wrong. Then he would constantly mention how hot she was, even in pictures of us together he would say we were the hottest ones in the picture. I eventually reached my limit with one of his comments and I told him how upset it made me. He never mentioned her again after that.

He also often talks about celebrities that he thinks are really hot, which I didn’t mind at first because who doesn’t have celebrity crushes. But then he would go on and on about how hot they are, which bothers me because I don’t look anything like any of the girls he talks about. Even on his birthday when I got him a gift, he said his favourite birthday gift was a video of a celebrity twerking that his friend sent him. I got sort of jokingly upset about a comment he made, but basically implied that I don’t want to hear about things like that. He talks about it a lot less now, but because of all of this, it bothers me when I see that he has liked pictures of celebrities in bikinis on Instagram. I never say anything because I know that it is unreasonable to be upset over social media because it doesn’t mean anything.

He thinks that he is pretty unattractive and sometimes it makes me feel like he thinks he has to settle for me. I was especially hurt recently when we were having a conversation. I said if Brad Pitt was our age I wouldn’t want to date him because he would cheat on me (it made sense in the conversation). Then he said that if he was our age that he would not date me. I’m not trying to say that I could date young Brad Pitt, but I just feel like your boyfriend should not say things like that. When I seemed kind of offended it seemed like he tried to make it better by saying that if Angelina Jolie was our age he could never get her. Then he said that’s why it’s good we have each other. That only made it worse and he got kind of weird after that. He just trying to be cute and nice to me to fix what he said. I didn’t act like it bothered me. It just made me feel like he thinks he can date me because he thinks I’m not that great.

I’m not sure if I am being dramatic this but it really hurt my feelings. Even though we’ve talked about many things, all of them together just makes it worse. I’m not sure if I should try to talk to him about this. I’ve been considering breaking up with him. I want to have a boyfriend that is with me because he wants to be with me, not because he feels like he can’t do any better.

Also if anyone thinks this is a factor, I believe I have high self esteem. I personally think I’m attractive and I’ve had others tell me as well. Regardless, it still hurts to think my boyfriend may not think so.

(Side note: he does also compliment me often and tells me I am out of his league. I’m just not sure if he says those things just because he thinks he’s supposed to, or if he really believes it.)

TL;DR
My boyfriend unknowingly says insulting things to me and I’m not sure if I should stay with him.",relationships
"How to end a long term relationship with someone you love? (19M) (20F)

I (19M) have been dating the same girl (20F) since just after my 16th birthday. I am not happy dating her any more. I still care about her a ton, and there are still good times had between us. I just grew up and realized don’t want to marry her, and now that we’re not kids, I know breaking up is the right thing to do. We have our issues, we’ve been working through them for years, but in my eyes, we are too different from each other in some important ways. I don’t like blaming things on her, but I would say a big part of it is that she is very sensitive, while I’m very go with the flow, and I often upset her without meaning to (like weekly, and it’s often a big deal). My best friend tells me that our relationship is toxic, and I believe him.

Anyways, I still love her a lot. She’s been through a lot and the thought of causing her more pain is debilitating to me (I would also say I suck at confrontation in general). She has been through a lot and this would affect her greatly, and our lives are a bit intermingled, making things more difficult. I know she sees us being together forever, and this is a thought I’ve entertained as well, but now that I’m older I’m realizing that this is not what I want.

I need good advice on how to break up with my first love, whom I still care about a great deal.

"I will try and make this short and sweet.

Ex and I broke up a few months back. I did the whole no contact thing, a couple weeks ago she came by to drop things off and told me she still wants me in her life etc. I told her there’s way too much there for us to just be friends. She agreed, but said she wants to spend time together and take things slow.

I was very diligent about letting her set the pace, set up plans, etc. aside from once or twice I had asked her to come over, she made all of our plans over the last few weeks. 

She began telling me she loves me, why I’m amazing, all of that. I let her lead the way and would react accordingly trying my best to not “push”.

The other night we were talking and she said it felt like we were in a relationship again, etc and she felt a lot of pressure and had a panic attack. I told her if she wants to stop things, it’s up to her and I’m not going to try and convince her otherwise or beg. 

She just kept saying she’s not ready for a relationship. 

After she left I told her I’m not gonna cut her out of my life and if she wants to spend time together and not worry about the pressure of a looming relationship (like we were supposed to be doing anyway?!) to let me know. She said she will soon.

I haven’t contacted her since that last conversation. This whole thing feels shitty and overwhelming now like I feel that void again from when we first broke up but obviously not as intense as I have a lot more tools in my toolbox to deal with it. 

Any Advice on what to do? Should I continue to not contact her in any form and just see if she hits me up?

TLDR: my ex came back after months, we took things slow, she said she felt too much pressure (which I was diligent about not applying) and said she’s not ready for a relationship

I said I trust her and she assures me that she's not interested in other romantic contacts because she's with me. But last week, she had a new contact, a guy, that keeps sending her messages asking for photos and asking her if she's already in bed and what she's wearing. She's also sending texts when she's naked in bed while I'm in another room. I confronted her with those texts and she assured me that if he's trying to get involved romantically, she's going to block him. But she didn't. She's now still constantly texting him.

"So ive (f31) have been seeing some guy(m41) for a while now . He persued me and insisted i take a chance on him - id not long got divorced - and wasnt too sure i was ready. 

Anyway i thought on it and took a leap. We were really happy , get on so well, everything was perfect and suddenly he starts to pull away. No reason no warning , just ends it. 

A month or so later we start things back up again everything was going great but then i found out there was someone else. Hed never met her just messaging . By this time i was in too deep. We go our seperate ways and again.

 about 2 months later we start spending time together but not actually in a relationship, i was good with this, he was good with this. Weve been plodding along getting closer again, he felt like my best friend, but he keeps messing with my head, one minute wants to make it offical were made for eachother then the next says he just wants fun as hes no good at relationships.

Now i was good with either i just expected a bit of respect... i kept my mouth shut mostly as to not cause any friction, as i said it was good. But fast forward to now and i finally had enough of the headf*ckery and told him i deserve better. He then exploded at me telling me im controlling and wont let him live his life the way he wants. So one night a few days later i got very drunk and told him exactly what i thought and let everything out that id been holding in he now hates me and blames me for everything that went wrong, 

i was finally   standing up for my beliefs and wanting answers as to why he treated me that way again. Hes made me feel awful about thinking about myself and putting my own feelings first for a change. Trouble is i absolutely love the guy and vowed to stand by him because he has issues too.

We never post each other on social medias or anything bc we don’t use them that much.

As crazy as it may sound, love sometimes makes you think stupid things i guess, id be willing to try again.

On my end, I think I learned to be more realistic. I had this idea of love being how it is portrayed in the movies, but it’s not. I also learned that it takes two people who are willing to put in the effort to make a relationship work.

"TL;DR my 6 year relationship ended and she shows signs that she still has feelings for me but wants me to move on and she wants to force herself to forget me. 

On April 5th my 6 year relationship ended after our March anniversary. The reason being because I took her for granted by not listening and compromising. She said she lost some feelings and was confused, I broke up the relationship and toxickly begged for her back through cutting and border line suecide. Then I took her to a park where we kissed and held hands and I messed it up again through my toxic way of being. Her reasoning of loosing feelings turned to ""I realize I still have the emotions I thought I lost, turned to"" to forget me, I want to reach my full potential and maybe date someone else in the future."" To"" who knows what the future will bring but i dont want to be with you right now"" all because of my toxic way of begging and not accepting her request for time to herself. What should I do guys? I know I should focus on myself but I don't want to loose her and my thoughts make me be impulsive. Today I talked to her and she still wants me to forget her and move on and she says she tried to delete our old photos from her phone but she ended up finding more and still has not been able to.",relationships
"I'm a very anxious person, I get attached too quickly and I try to get things right. A girl laid eyes on me and had a crush on me really quick, and since I was craving for love I went on with it. Turns out she's amazing, funny, smart, we get along pretty well. I always call her names such as baby, princess, cutie and stuff, even if we've only been flirting for like 3 weeks... I also reply way too fast since I work from the computer, I play in the computer, I watch shows in the computer so basically I'm there when I get a message. The thing is that I've always been very clingy and usually I drive away people and I'm noticing I'm doing the same thing in this new potential relationship that I might get into.

The thing is that when I try to give her the space she deserves, or I try to not be as clingy with the name-calling she starts to think that I'm mad at her and she then becomes sad or confused and starts questioning me, I tell her that I'm alright but she just doesn't buy it. She openly told me that if I do not call her a cute name she immediately thinks I'm annoyed (I'm glad we have enough trust for her to share that with me). But I do not feel ready to tell her about how I'm actively trying to be less cringy, I do not want to scare her away, but since she's used to this now, if I change she'll think something is wrong, when it isn't.

"We've been dating for about 4 months but did know each other previously and I am very much in love with him. He's really into working out and early on he told me that when he gets to a certain weight naturally he wants to begin taking steroids to see how strong he can get with their help. I told him I wasn't cool with that but we kind of left it as a problem for future us to deal with (with me joking around that we would break up once he hit his goal weight and him joking that I'd love him too much by then).

Well during quarantine he's had a lot of time on his hand to work out and is almost at his goal weight. He broached the topic again in a more serious way. It's something that he really wants to do and sees as a self-improvement goal. I hate standing in the way of someone's improvement but after reading the limited research and information on it I don't feel comfortable with the idea of it (I've always had a wariness regarding mind altering substances). I told him I would prefer that we don't continue seeing each other if he wants to go down this path. 

He wants to do a 500 mg/week test only 20 week cycle. It seems like he wants to use long-term but will stop if there are any serious side effects. He understands my decision but feels like I'm not trusting his judgment and the research that he's done on it. He said he won't do it because he doesn't think it's worth losing me over but he's been acting kind of distant ever since (for 1 day).

I feel guilty that I'm preventing him from doing what he wants and don't know if my existing fears/biases are making me blow this out of proportion. Am I being unreasonable?

They tell me that I'm kind, smart, and attractive with big curves(fyi I'm 5'2 and 100 lbs) but that they would never date me. I've even developed feelings for some of my guy friends after opening up and hanging out with them, but when I confess, they always reject me coldly and ghost me after. One example is that for the past year, I had a huge crush on this guy in one of my classes, and we started studying together as friends. We started slowly opening up about our future goals, family life, and we even cried in front of each other. He was always staring at my body and checking me out, so I thought that maybe he was interested since he's single. I confessed before college closed due to the pandemic, and he didn't reply and ghosted me. I felt so embarrassed for misinterpreting him.

"(throwaway because my GF and I share a Reddit account)

Yesterday, my GF began to cry uncontrollably. 

When I (23M) finally calmed her down she told me that she didn't feel the same way about us anymore (that things were ""different""). However, she also told me that she loved me and that she can't picture her life without me. 

 She says that since she's never experienced this situation before, she doesn't have a point of reference and doesn't know what to do. If she didn't really love me, she says it would be an easy decision but the fact that she can't picture a life where she doesn't get to wake up to me in the morning and enjoy all the other small things together would be impossible (since we live together as well).  

Although I appreciate her honesty 100% she feels terrible knowing that I'm in distress, caught in limbo while she figures her stuff out.

I tried explaining to her I'd be fine with time if we broke up, but she doesn't want to jump to that conclusion because she doesn't know if that's even the right thing to do. I feel like there's hope given that she's explicitly told me she doesn't want to break up. But at the same time, I don't know how I should feel about the situation. Apart of me feels like she's staying with me out of pity and every 'I love you' and touch from then on is empty and I should set up walls around my heart now (given that this has happen to me before a couple of times), however, the other side of the argument loves her too much to do that and would rather fall hard if she decides, in the end, she wants to close the chapter in our relationship. I love her and it would devastate me having to let her go, but I don't want to keep her from being happy even if it isn't with me. Although if we do break up, I would more than likely have to cut her off completely while I heal which she knows.

However, apart of me feels like we can work through this given we're both openly communicating and have explicitly said so far ""we don't want to break up"" and I'm looking for advice (even if it's not what I want to here) if anyone's ever experienced a situation like this.

"Ok, so throwaway account because this is sensitive. I (33F) was using my mate's (33M) gaming phone for YouTube and Google searching something. App crashed and I opened the browser history to get the page beck and saw his porn history. We've been together for 3 years, and as someone who watches porn regularly, I have no problem with the fact that he watches porn, nor does it bother me what he watches. What is kinda bugging me is how tame our sex is given some of the stuff he watches. 
He had turned down many of my sexual interests such as anal and porn during sex, and he prefers just 2 positions. I also woke up to him watching porn on his phone in bed once, which turned into an argument because he didn't want me to see what he was watching, and him hiding something from me rubbed me the wrong way. The argument was resolved, however, if I'm honest, it made me feel inadequate that he'd prefer to watch porn while I'm right next to him instead of  him having sex with me.
Having seen his history, I don't want to make him feel bad, but I'm a bit annoyed that he's watching all this freaky shit, and all I get (when we do have sex) is missionary. 
How do I get him to open up more sexually? Or should I just forget about what I've seen and accept that he's just not that sexual in bed?

I was always the one initiating the conversations so one day i just stopped to see if she would initiate. She didn't. Is there any particular reason why she stopped or what is it that i don't get?

TL;DR: This girl never initiated an conversation when i stopped even though i thought it was good between us.",relationships
"As the title says I keep having dreams about my old friend, who I haven't talked to in about 3 years. I continue to have dreams where she has romantic feelings for me and I do as well. The problem is though, I only dream about the old her, how she looked and acted when we first met (who I had a crush on at the time). And I'm also in a relationship now.

After these dreams I feel great sadness and guilt. It's gotten better now, but I still want to give her a call to see how she's doing. I have her contacts but I'm always too nervous to actually talk to her. I'm not pursuing a relationship with her, I just want to see how she's doing and how much she's changed. I've seen her a couple times in the past and her appearance and style has changed so much she's almost unrecognizable. It's strange because in my dreams she always looks like the old her before she changed. 

It's true I did have a crush on her when we first met, and I'm sure she did too, but I'm in a happy relationship now and don't want to ruin that. She was also kind of a toxic person, which I know to stay away from. I'm just conflicted whether I should give her a call or not. I'm sure she's doing fine but.. in reality I think this call is more for me. I'm not sure what I want from it, but I know I want to talk to her.

Should I give her a call? What could I say to start a conversation after 3 years? Or should I talk to my boyfriend about it?

TL:DR 
I continue to have dreams about a friend who I stopped talking to about 3 years ago. In these dreams we are romantic. I want to talk to her again but in a friendly manner. I'm not sure how to go about this.",relationships
"So mother just turned 53 and has always been a young and beautiful person. However, she's one of those who have to try and use whatever beauty procedure or product that turns up. From an ideological standpoint that annoys me, since it's superficial and totally aloof from the reality we live in. But this is not the main issue here.

At some point last year she made herself graded colored contact lenses. She's a light skinned black woman with dark brown eyes, and bought herself grey-greenish lenses. She explained me that she bought colored lenses because they were cheaper,... which still is a very dumb thing to do. They're cheaper because they're probably of lesser quality.

She also got her eyebrows tattooed (micropigmented). The first time I saw it they were like two very dark and defined bars. She told me they would look faded, but after months still are two dark very edged bars.

The problem is that specially with the lenses I'm having a hard time to recognize my mother. It annoys me when we facetime, as I can't get over that image which looks like an imposter. The problem is not her wanting to look young, there's plenty of ways she could do so still resembling herself.

Today I told her that I'd rather have her facetiming me using glasses, as I struggle trying to recognize her in that image. Is that to harsh of me? Am I wrong for wanting to be able to see my mom in her?

I wouldn't complain if she didn't feel alright as a woman and wanted to identify herself as a trans man. I'm aware it would be very insensitive and egotistical to complain in that scenario. But her already being a beautiful woman as she's always has been, I just can't get over all these unnecessary beauty modifications and addons. 

TL:DR! Mother insists in using colored lenses and using besuty procedures, giving me a hard time to recognize my mother in her.",relationships
"We've been together for about a year and a half and for the most part everything is great. BF is super loving and affectionate and we've talked about our future plans and are about to buy a place together.

However, as much as I try to ignore it, I can't get over the feelings my boyfriend has for his ex.

He dated his ex for a year and they had a bad breakup a year before we met. My bf tends to over-share a bit too much, so he's told me in the past how he was in love with this girl and how their relationship was ""on fire"" cause they had the same creative passion for music and would write lyrics together. The way he talks about it, she was basically his muse and inspired all his creativity during that time. In the end, she cheated on him, but he kept taking her back til they finally broke up and it left him really emotionally messed up.

Cut to our relationship now - bf says he's happy with me and completely over his past relationship, but his actions seem to say otherwise. If something reminds him of his ex, he gets very emotional. For example, we were watching a show the other day and one girl's looks/behaviour reminded him of his ex and he got very upset. He's also said he prefers me not to dye my hair red, because her hair is red. And last week, on her birthday, he got very upset and drank a lot. Now the thing is, my bf doesn't know that I know that it was his ex's birthday. And the next day he apologized for his behaviour but wouldn't say what made him so upset, even though he's normally super open with me about everything.

Then this week, he was talking about how he used to write with his ex and how writing with someone was such a great experience. He then asked me to try writing something and share it with him. I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting, but it just made me feel like his ex is always on his mind and I'm always being compared to her in some way. I really don't want to feel like I'm just a replacement filling the void that she left.

Sidenote: I've never had a serious past relationship where I've been in love with the person until now, so I'm finding it hard to tell if my bf's behavior is normal or concerning.  For those of you who have, did you still have feelings for your ex, even when you were happy in a new relationship?

I've talked to my bf about this before and suggested that he talk to a friend or a therapist so he can process the trauma from his last relationship, but he always shrugs it off and claims that he's over her and hates her.  I don't know what else to do.  This is starting to bother me a lot now to the point where I'm considering taking a break from the relationship or breaking up permanently. 

Has anyone been in a relationship with someone who still had feelings for their ex and been able to work through it?

tl;dr - My bf still gets very emotional and upset when he thinks about his ex. If he was really happy with me, shouldn't he be over it?  Is there any hope of us working through this or should I just end things before they get worse?",relationships
"I (20F) would say even as young as I am, I'm a lot older for my age (i.e. My friends are all 23+ just because I went through college fast, I'll be graduating this year so I have a lot of friends already starting life and settling whatnot) I've really taken some time to really understand myself and what I want my life to look like.  Like I said, I'm graduating this year, so way younger than when I am supposed to.  Career wise, I have already accepted and signed a job for right out of graduation with a well known company in a great department.  So I think in a lot of aspects, I have a very clear idea of what I want.  I am managing my debt, have worked to be financially independent since I was 16, so when I say I know what my priorities are, I know.

Relationship wise, I have been with this guy (23M)  for almost a year now, but I've seen and have really felt strongly that time doesn't tell anything, it's the quality of the relationship.  And I feel so convicted that this relationship will go very far.  And I'm ready to get this aspect of my life set in stone, I want to think about getting married and starting life out, doing life things with this guy, my best friend.  And I feel because of his age, he is kinda wanting to solidify some aspects of his life too.  And I've been through relationships where I came out and knew exactly what I *didn't* my next ones to look like.  And this relationship is everything my lasts ones have not been.  We took things really slow and nurtured this relationship; we've had issues, but always resolved very amicable and progressively.  We have a very progressive and dynamic relationship.  We're hitting each milestone and growing as people independently and making this relationship really just work so effortlessly and without stress.  We have also talked explicitly about what our future looks like together and he has agreed too that he sees me in his future.  We've talked about all the places we will travel together till we are old, what our wedding is look be like, if we like kids or not, what our house will look like, what kind of pet we look like. Honestly it could be a close epitome of an ideal relationship.  It has been everything I could hope and pray for.

The problem is that, I understand that years down in the future, so many things could happen.  Our careers could take us either way and right now our lives are about to change so dynamically, job opportunities, priorities, changing wants, personalities, I am fully aware of this.  But is it wrong for me to allow myself to imagine or put hope into a ""future future"": getting married, getting a house together, traveling the world together, starting the rest of our lives together in a partnership.  Is this me letting my guard down.  I am very cautious and aware that what I am putting hope in, very well might not happen, but another part of me feels really good about this relationship that I really feel like this will go far.  And it's just that \*gut\* feeling.  But like I mentioned, I know what I want my life to look like.  My career, my education, are all things I can control, but this relationship takes two.  He wants something similar but doesn't want to promise anything, nor do I because the future is not assured.  But is it wrong or reckless to believe in this?  This is genuinely something I want to invest in because it makes me truly happy.   Are all the talks of a future just loose talking?  He rarely says things he doesn't mean, but you know how people are.  There's still a fine line of wishful thinking and realistically thinking.  Should I just tread cautiously, still grow the relationship, but not expect a future at all to avoid getting my hopes up for something that \*might\* not happen?  But I feel really compelled to dedicate my life to this because it's worth it.  It's a thing I made my priority because all my other aspects of life are all set.  Which means I have to treat him like someone who could walk out of my life tomorrow and put up all my guards.  And we've always had a dynamic of two people who are committed with each other for a long long time.

**tldr: I'm in a great relationship I have so much faith I will have a future with my boyfriend.  But I'm scared I'm getting my hopes up imagining a future future.  Should I keep my expectations low and just enjoy it day by day or am a justified in putting hope in a future.**",relationships
"there's this person who i deeply love but i hurt them, basically i met them in a very bad time in my life and they were probably one of the best things that happened to me, unfortunately i was a very toxic person at the time without even realizing it, and i was toxic towards them but they didn't tell me because they loved me and cared for me and didn't want to hurt my feelings but it got to the point where i worried them way too much because of my suicidal thoughts and my generally bad mental health and they distanced themselves from me and i got angry at them because i thought that they just used me (because we both had crushes on each other) and now that theyre done with me and that they replaced me and now i realize how wrong i was, unfortunately i hurt them by going to an old mutual friend who they hated because they had a falling out with her and i said some bad things that i shouldn't have about my crush to her and then my crush found out and they told me everything and told me how bad i hurt them and about how much they cared for me and about how they didnt want to tell me how toxic i was being so they wouldnt hurt my feelings and now i really want to apologize because i realize how badly i hurt someone who i loved and cared about and who i didnt really want to hurt but i unfortantnly did because i was blinded by my paranoia and anger and stupidity but i dont know whats the best to apologize ? because if anything they deserve the very best apology i can write and i did learn from my mistakes and i realized how toxic i was being and im trying my best to change my behavior but i just really want them back, i dont want our relationship to be a bad memory for us because i deeply deeply love them and care for them so how do i apologize ? also should i mention that i was angry and thats why i did what i did ? or is that an excuse ? because i dont want them to think i hurt them for no reason but i dont want to make an excuse because there isnt any excuses for what i did because what i did was just wrong and was 100% my fault...so what do i do ? i do realize i might not get them back but if anything i just hope we can end our relationship on a good note because i don't want our fight to be the last thing between us

"I’ve been “dating” my girlfriend for about a week now (I say “dating” because we’re unofficial at the moment. The age of consent where I live is 17, while hers is 16) and my parents don’t like her. 

We met online, and hit it off rather quick. We called for the first time recently, and I had mentioned that my girlfriend had just finished a semester for college. My parents didn’t seem pleased by that, and asked where I had met her and why I was talking to her. 

My dad has been known to kick my sister out for things she did that he didn’t like, and I’m afraid he’ll kick me out as well if I tell him that I want to keep dating my girlfriend. 

TL;DR My parents don’t like my (unofficial) girlfriend and I’m worried my dad will kick me out for continuing to date her.

Edit : we’re not ACTUALLY dating yet. We’ve discussed that we won’t be involved romantically OR sexually until I am 17, and even then it will only be romantic terms until I am comfortable. Until then, we’re still friends, and getting to know one another and our limits. I am listening to my parents’s concerns, but they’re all just about being a bad influence for my younger cousin.",relationships
"Hi,
So I'm with my Gf since december, let's call her Clara. 
Clara got her master's degree last year and decided to take a year to find what she want to do in life (a little bit late but whatever, idk what I'm doing neither). She is going to an art school during this year.

Her mother and father where flight attendants. She decided to apply to be one. She got hired and she was stoked. I was too ! They were plenty of benefits for her and for us. 

I said that she got hired but that's not 100% the case. She got approved to do her training and she'll have a 3 months contract at the end of it. After those 3 months, she'll be able to have a longer contract. 

Anyways, C19 ruined it. After the first day of the lockdown, the airline company stopped her training and went silent. They'll probably never resume her training.

Clara said she's applying for jobs regularly but she's got no answers yet. She's applying for student jobs (since she still is a student) and real jobs. As for now, she didn't told me where she applied. She spoke to me about two jobs : one that should be her dream job but she's missing a social status that we need in my country. **She can** have it easily. 

The other one that she spoke to me before applying is surpsingly the only one that she got an answer of. You'll need a bit of context to understand : 

One day, Clara told me about ""this girl"" who is selling clothes and who is clairly making a lot of money. She's basically buying stuff on Alibaba and sells it on Facebook, she's kind of an influencer so she's selling her crap super fast. Clara is one of her follower on Facebook. But she criticizes her whenever something appears on Facebook. Clara and that girl shares totally opposites values. While Clara is more of an ""all natural"" and ""I only buy what I need"" girl, this girl is ... Ffs she's an influencer that sells her crap on Facebook. Do I need to elaborate ? 

So this Influencer said she's in need of students to work for her. Clara applied and got ""hired"" (sort of ?!). The girl called her and basically said ""I liked your profile and I'll contact you if I need you, you need to be super reactive"". 
It's basically a job where she'll be called when there's too much work to be done on certain days. 

Clara is living at a 1hour/10€ drive of this job. Clara is making plan to sleep at her brother's place, at my place, ... 

I said to her that while I support her, I don't think it's healthy for her to do this job. She's got some mental breakdown and she already said that she'll need to ""play a role"" to do this job. 

She basically said that I don't have to say a word because I was never in need of money and I never worked of my life nor needed to find a job (while I'm doing a 2 year internship that is basically a job, which I needed to do a dozen of interviews to find). 

For me, she's clearly taking the easy path and it drives me crazy. I didn't said anything but I'm not thinking less ... What can I do ? 

tl;dr : C19 ruined dream job of my GF, she's telling me that she's applying for jobs everyday and she got one where it's not healthy for her to work at.",relationships
"Semi-long story pls bear with me. 

Me and my boyfriend started long distance, him living in Australia and me living in Canada. Things were going really really great for nearly 2 years so we made the decision for him to move to me in Canada. He's been here nearly a year now and things were going so well at first. We were getting along perfectly, very similar to how things had been going online. 

|| a little back story for context - my boyfriend has always been a ""mamas boy"" and very close to his mum. And had just started building a better relationship with his father as well before leaving ||

This whole Covid thing started and he started getting very worried about his parents health being so far away. I explained to him that I would 100% be ok and supportive of him flying back to spend time with them during this but unfortunately we didn't have the funds. This was back in late February. 

This past month I had a close family member pass away very unexpectedly and it's raised his anxiety about the whole thing like crazy. Not only about them catching covid, but them getting sick in general. It's gotten to the point where he says he thinks about it many times every day. Which is starting to negatively affect our relationship because his mood is constantly down. He's been playing video games for 10+ hours a day with his friends to try to distract himself, he's started to have a very short temper, he pretty much stopped putting in effort into our relationship. I have brought this up with him multiple times now &amp; he says that it's really hard for him to put effort into it while his mind is stuck in a dark place. 

Now don't get me wrong, I can't even imagine what hes feeling being so far away from his parents while having anxiety about their deaths. I'm not trying to make him feel wrong or invalid for feeling like this. But we can't continue on how we are right now for much longer. I have suggested he sees a professional so that they can help him with some tools to cope but he doesn't think he'll be able to open up to a stranger. 

Today, we had a talk about all of this and he said that the only way he thinks he'll be happy again is going back to Australia because then he will stop worrying so much. He says he is mostly worried that IF they do get sick one day, he will resent me/moving to Canada because he could've been in Aus making more memories with them.


For me, death is just a part of life and I'm not as scared of it so my advice to him doesn't help. How can I help him cope with these thoughts he's having? I'm not ready to give up on this relationship yet, but I also just want him to be happy. Is there any way we can have the best of both worlds here?


TLDR - my boyfriend has become very anxious of his parents dying while he lives on the other side of the world. Our relationship is starting to fail because of it. What kind of tools can I give him to help him cope with his fear?",relationships
"Question people of Reddit.

Would you consider it to be cheating if you broke up with a girl for a day so you could fool around with the girl best friend you told her about, and then went back to your girlfriend for the relationship you were missing and she asks if you did anything with the girl...so you lie about it to make her feel like she is crazy and paranoid and there’s nothing between them, and they’re still hanging out all the time? (this is from a past relationship, not current. I just don’t know how to describe it to people because I’m not sure if I can call it cheating if he lied but physically to my knowledge did nothing with this girl while we were together, but emotionally he was with her and they dated after we ended our relationship).

tl;dr In summary, a toxic guy in my life manipulated me into feeling like my emotions were invalid and told me I didn’t really love or trust him if I questioned his feelings for his friend. He lied to me and I don’t know if I can call it cheating. Advice?

He was 16 and I was 17 at the time (I’m a girl).

Thank you",relationships
"My first year of college (two years ago), I met a girl who was still in a relationship from high school. We became best friends and we would be each others' shoulder to cry on. This past year, her boyfriend came to visit for quite a few weekends and every time he did, she would spend almost no time with me. Sure, we would hang out together in groups and have fun when her boyfriend visited, but we never spent any ""real"" time together talking or anything like that. She always likes to cuddle with me and I don't mind at all, but this past year I've started to realize how she only does things like this with me because she can't be with her boyfriend. It makes me feel a little used if I'm being honest. As if I'm her body pillow for her to cuddle and talk to when she's not with her boyfriend. She even mentioned one time in passing that she wouldn't be friends with me if she wasn't in a relationship when she met me and I can't even begin to comprehend what this means. I understand that she'll naturally want to spend more time with her boyfriend, and be more intimate when he's around, but to completely disregard me when he's around and still call me her best friend doesn't feel right to me. Is our friendship real or am I being used?

TL;DR: After I became best friends with this girl I met in college, I began to realize that she'll never want to spend time with me as long as she's able to be with her boyfriend. Is our friendship real or am I being used?

EDIT: People seem to think that I am attracted to her, but I really value our friendship and wouldn't sacrifice it to start a risky relationship.",relationships
"When I (19F)was a Freshman in high school, I fell in love with someone(19M)  for the first time. It was one of those feelings that give you constant butterflies when you think or speak to that person. We dated for a good bit, but then he broke up with me for another girl. I was devastated and absolutely crushed. After awhile, we became friends again and have been ever since. I am now a Sophomore in college. I broke up with a very short term relationship about 2 months ago. The night before I did it, I called the boy I had fallen in love with so long ago and spoke to him about what was going on and he helped me talk myself through it. A few days after breaking up with that short term relationship, the boy from high school drove two hours to see me. We've been hanging out a lot and he drives two hours to my apartment every week. He wants a relationship, but I'm very unsure. I just really need some opinions.

"My boyfriend and I are coming up on our 2 year anniversary. I consider him my soul mate and I love him more than anything. We have lived together for about a year now. 

When we first were dating before we got serious I saw notifications from dating apps pop up on his phone a few times. I didn’t like it but we hadn’t discussed exclusivity so I never brought it up. 

We’ve been spending more time than usual together while in quarantine. I don’t have his passcode to his phone and have no reason to look at it. But a few times when I happened to glance at it (check if it needs to be plugged in, needed a flashlight in a pinch) I saw dating app notifications on the lock screen again. 

The first couple times it happened I brushed it off, like maybe the app still sends you notifications even if you aren’t active, unless you go back and delete your profile? And then one day he left his phone unlocked and curiosity got the better of me, and I quickly looked at one of the apps. He had ongoing recent conversations with a bunch of girls. It looked like just chatting and trying to get them to flirt but maybe not actually meeting up. 

I also realized that we never technically had an exclusivity conversation...eventually in our relationship when we were together 24/7 it just seemed to go without saying. 

Am I partly at fault for not making an explicit agreement about exclusivity? Is this cheating? Am I also in the wrong for snooping in his phone? How do I bring this up to him and what do I say?!

"I'm a 31F with a 28F sister. We were raised in a dysfunctional family and have been living with just each other as roommates for about three years now.  I know everyone will say 'move out' but that is not currently an option for me.   

TL;DR: My sister is an adult who told me she won't do chores unless I prompt her. When I do, she treats me like garbage. I'm sick of it. She wouldn't help me come up with an actual system for chores, so I did it myself. Now she is treating me badly and I am upset and don't know what to do going forward.

I have an immediate situation I'd like input on but I know this is a pattern for me and I will seek out some therapy. In the meantime, I don't know what to do about my current situation.   

When we first started living together, my sister told me that she ""doesn't see mess"" but that I should just tell her when things need to be done and she will do them.   

Now I know that's just bullshit, but we had a semi-hoarded house growing up, so at the time I thought it was completely reasonable that she had issues identifying what's mess/not.   

I'm sure you can imagine that this has not worked out well. Basically what happens is, I ask her to do things (like she requested) but often she doesn't do them. This leads to me either giving up and doing them myself or requesting again which leads to her feeling like I'm an evil nagging harpy and eventually lashing out.  

When this happens, I tell her this ""Just tell me and I'll do it"" strategy is not working and needs to change. I try to get her to come up with another solution with me and she usually is still mad and either gets angry with me or refuses to talk about it and goes in her room. Then I don't want to bring it up at another time because I don't want her to be nasty to me.    

I get why she thinks I'm a shitty person who orders her around all the time but I am really at a loss for what to do here. The division of labor is completely unacceptable and I feel like I'm 'in charge' of her adult responsibilities. Some of these things are ones that I can let go, and others aren't. For example, in the last three years she has gotten her own mail probably less than 10 times. When she does goes to the mailbox, she has to ask me what the number is, because it's been so long she doesn't remember. This affects me because we have a tiny little mailbox. When it fills up, the mail will get held at the post office. I get my mail and I don't want to have to go all the way down there to pick my mail up just because she doesn't get want to get hers. There are many other examples but this is already too long.   

Based on some of the things she's said and the general way she treats things, I believe she feels that the apartment and all responsibilities that come with it are mine, and that she views anything she does around the apartment (aside from her own laundry and possibly dishes) as 'favors' for me. 

I know this cycle is shitty and won't end well. I also know that any type of chore system I try to make on my own is likely to go over like a lead balloon. But I did it anyway today because she has refused to help come up with a better one with me and I am sick of having to remind her to do stuff. I made a spreadsheet of all the chores in the apartment, and told her she should just date and initial under whatever one she does. That way, it will be clear to both of us who has done what, and whose turn it is. I told her I made it and that she can make whatever changes she wants to, or she can come up with a better system. I don't care how stuff gets done as long as it's fair. 

Well, she screamed at me earlier and then has been in her room. She wrote me an e-mail basically saying that I shouldn't talk to her anymore or she will scream at me, implying that it will be my fault for her choice to scream at me. So once again, everything is my responsibility. I don't even know how to respond or what to do. At this point I figure I will just ignore her because that's what she wants and I don't care to be screamed at. However, I also think it's really childish and won't solve anything, so I would like some other ideas. 

And for anyone who wants to suggest the ""You Should Have Asked"" comic, I showed it to her and she called it condescending and said I don't consider all the emotional labor she does. Since, presumably, she will scream at me if I ask, I guess I won't know what emotional labor she thinks she does.

" 

Alright so this may sound odd but it's something I've been dealing with for years now and have spoken in length about it to friends, therapists, etc. I apologize for the length of this but I could really use some input/advice. I harbor no ill will towards my ex and still love her in a way to this very day.

Years ago I entered into a long distance relationship with a girl, my first ever girlfriend. For context I live in New York, she lives in Texas. It was our first ""real"" relationship and despite the distance we were determined to make it work. We dated for around a year before I finally went to Texas to meet her in person, things went incredibly well and I spent roughly a week there before I was forced to return home. During the time from when we started dating until that trip she had told me she loved me over Skype, I felt the same way of course so I said it back to her and we pledged ourselves to each other. I was 19-20 at the time (I'm a male if that matters) and she was 18-19 (obviously female).

We were in love and we swore to each other that we would only love each other, would only want to be with the other and would be married and such one day. From the day I made that oath to her I stuck to it, no other girl had my attention and I was wholly hers and hers alone. I went to Texas, spent the time there and things went well or so I thought.

She had told me to message her when I landed back in NY, and the first thing I did once I landed was message her. I didn't hear back for three months, no explanation, nothing. I assumed that perhaps she had been busy with school since she moved back in to her dorm the day I left and I assumed her classes were keeping her occupied. So for three months I tried to go about my daily life, I went to school, work etc as I did before and I stuck to my oath to her.

After three months I got a message from her apologizing, she asked me if she could have time to think about things, I asked her if she was alright or if she needed anything and she just asked for time so I accepted. This feeds into another vow I made to her to always heed her needs and requests, and to never hurt her.

So I waited and I waited over time growing more and more concerned. During this time I lost my job, I was forced to leave school and undergo knee reconstruction surgery and rehabilitation. My mental state began to decline and at this point I hadn't heard from her in around 7 months since she had asked me for time, any messages between us had been scattered not talking about our relationship. She would reach out to me to vent about life and I was more than happy to lend an ear. The night before my surgery I was terrified posting as much to Facebook. She reached out to assure me I would be alright before vanishing again.

From there my mental state went further, between the pain from the surgery, the heavy amounts of painkillers I was on, the forced reliance on others as I was essentially helpless and so on I fell into full blown depression. One night months later I unknowingly ( I had taken the painkillers that night and they made me forget things) messaged her and vented. I wanted answers why she still at this point a year after saying she needed time still hadn't spoken to me and had been leading me on but refused to talk to me despite our oaths to each other and despite our mutual love. I didn't remember writing that message come the next morning, so to my surprise the night after she messaged me back ending things.

She told me that she didn't want to feel like she had done anything wrong, that she needed time and that despite loving me it was time for her to move on for in her words ""both of our sakes"". She told me I deserved to be with someone who loved me and made me happy and after a year of telling me she needed time to think she ended things abruptly, no explanation, no warning, nothing.

To say I was devastated would be an understatement. I messaged my friends hysterical, I didn't want to live anymore at that point, I called my mom crying and told her I couldn't take it anymore and I walked from my house to the nearest main road and attempted to end the pain but was stopped by my father and brothers.

I didn't eat after that, I didn't drink, shower, anything. I sat in my chair crying until I couldn't cry anymore and I passed out. I spent months like that, only doing the bare minimum to survive but not to live. I had lost the will to live.

Now I'm 25 years old, I still haven't moved on, I still love her. Over the years since she ended things I had opportunities come up for me to possibly begin a new relationship with someone new. I found out from a mutual friend that she had begun dating someone else a few months after leaving me thus breaking the oath she had made to me.

But to this day 5 years later I still haven't broken my oath that she would be my one and only and nobody else. I've always aspired to be an honorable man, a man of my word and always strove to uphold any oath I have ever made.

Last night I was talking to my best friend about this, he told me that while it is commendable that even after all this time I am still honoring the oath, the oath is gone and I am freed from it.

His reasoning is that since she and I both made the same oath to each other and she broke hers by ending our relationship then she involuntarily caused me to break mine and as it was not done by my choice I technically stuck to my word all this time. He argues that I am now free of the oath and no longer bound to her and I am now permitted to move on and try to find another relationship.

My question is, is he correct? Does the fact that she ended things/ broke her side of the oath therefore nullify my oath to her and free me to move on?

Would it be going against my aim to keep my word at all cost and diminish my personal honor? Or is the oath officially dissolved and due to it being out of my control I haven't done anything wrong?

I know this sounds stupid nowadays but it is something that I have been clinging to for years. Am I free from my oath?

**TL;DR: I Was in a relationship years ago that she ended without any input of mine and completely out of my control after I made an oath as well as she to always stay faithful and that we would be each others one and only. Am I freed from that oath?**",relationships
"Bf (27) and I (28) have been dating for almost 3 years. We live together and have a pretty good relationship, but we do have conflicts and maybe argue a tad more than the average couple. We both want to do couples therapy but have been putting off because of the cost.

I've been in therapy for about a year now for personal issues and it's been incredibly helpful. My boyfriend has seen a therapist for a very short time and he liked it but when he got out of the military he stopped. 

My boyfriend is applying to be a police officer soon, which he's wanted to for a while, and this is where this life coach comes in. The coach has been our mutual friend for a couple years, and although he's only 3 years older than my boyfriend, he's been a cop since he was around 20. Because he's been a cop for so long he also makes a lot of money so he owns a house, a big truck, goes on lots of vacations etc. He does seem to live the ""perfect life"" according to what we know of him and what social media tells us. He found his 'soulmate' recently, they got engaged within one year, call each other King and Queen, basically everything in his life seems to be perfect. And, since his fiance is a life coach, he recently also decided he would become one and took the course, which was essentially a weekend course for a significant amount of money. 

This brings us to the problem: my boyfriend, since he really looks up to his friend, has lapped up what this friend is saying. When my boyfriend first told me he was thinking about having his friend coach him I was very verbal about my discontent with it, for two reasons. One, the issues my boyfriend have (addiction to video games) in my opinion is something that should be dealt with by a professional, and second, the ridiculous amount of money this ""8-week program"" would be (over $1100!! This is more than I'm paying a licensed therapist!).

 To me it's clear that our friend sees it as an easy way to make money while also feeling good about trying to help others. Our friend has absolutely no formal education, has never been to school or taken any psychology courses, etc. He literally just had the money to do the course, has the money to do marketing and that's it. He's not a specialist or renowned as a police officer, he's just your average Joe with lots of money.

I feel like this friend has used my boyfriend's moderately low self-worth and trusting nature plus friend status as a means to get his business. This friend also has not had one customer, and what he's marketing sounds closer to what a therapist does than anything else.

My biggest thing here is the money: when my boyfriend originally brought this up to me a few months ago, we got into a spat and I told him how ridiculous that amount was for someone who has never even gone to school and had no knowledge whatsoever about any of what he wanted to teach. (For example this coaches Instagram is literally just motivational quotes. Every day. I don't think he's posted one thing that has been his). 

We got over it and I thought that was that and that he would drop it. However my boyfriend decided to go ahead with it, without telling me because he knew I disapproved. Yesterday after a ""hangout"" with this friend he came home and told me, oh, so actually I'm doing the coaching. I was completely taken aback. He told me that he wasn't paying the full amount... But he refused to tell me how much he's paying so that tells me it's still a significant amount.

We had another argument about it, but it feels like my boyfriend is completely enthralled and not hearing any logic. I'm now feeling resentment and anger not only to my boyfriend, but to our friend as well. My boyfriend and I have talked about how we should do couples therapy many times but we have both put it off because of money reasons, and I feel hurt that he would decide to put his money towards ""supporting a friend"" (one of his reasons) rather than something tangible like working on our relationship, or even going to a proper therapist to help him with his addiction.

 I also 100% do not think my boyfriend needs to be life-coached by this friend. The friend has told me boyfriend that their relationship will remain the same but I also don't believe that. I see a big power dynamic here even though my boyfriend insists that's not the case. I'm also uncomfortable with my boyfriend bringing up relationship issues because this is a mutual friend. 

Is my boyfriend being taken advantage of or am I way out of line here? I've definitely lost respect for my boyfriend and I'm not sure where to go from here. Unless I'm completely wrong in not trusting him? I don't know...

TL;dr: our mutual friend recently became a life coach. He talked my boyfriend into becoming his first customer and even though I was clear about my disapproval and why, he went ahead with it anyway. He wouldn't tell me the cost because he also knew I wouldn't approve.  We need couples therapy for communication issues but haven't been able to because of the cost, and I'm feeling resentment that my boyfriend is paying for this life coaching first over fixing our relationship.",relationships
"Context: I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for about four years. We met at a restaurant we were working at when I was in college and he had graduated the spring before (so 20 and 24). He was a shift supervisor but was never my “boss”, as anyone who had worked in restaurants has known.

For the first two years, I was in school so we didn’t live together. I eventually quit working In the restaurant but it was his career so he stayed. During this time, he got a DWIA (in Colorado, so blood alcohol between 0.05 and 0.08). We worked through it together and I never judged him for it. He acknowledged from the start it was a mistake (we were driving together when it happened after a date night), never denied that it had happened but just wanted to move past it.

As time went on, we moved to another town so I could start my first job. It was close enough he kept working in the same restaurant (a different one than the one we first worked in, but higher end). Later, I got the opportunity for a big job so we moved from Colorado to the East Coast. He didn’t want to get stuck in restaurant work again so our plan was for him to work 100% on getting a job and I would work full time.

Unfortunately, as anyone knows it’s hard to move careers after 12 years (he was trying to get into a medical type role). So he only got a few interviews between August and now. He got into an EMT training program so (COVID notwithstanding) he’ll be a full time EMT by the beginning of August (he wants to go to PA school after a few years). We have a kitten together, we have lived together for two years, dated for four and a half years, we moved across the country together, we’re planning on getting married when it’s financially smart to, etc. Basically, we’re in for the long haul. 

Situation: Everything seems hunky dory except for my big sister (30F) constantly harassing me about him. The second she heard we were dating she went on about how he was a “predator” and a “cheat” who harassed young girls (which, wtf? And also I initiated our relationship, which she knows). It’s been four and a half years and still hates him. She goes on and on about how he’s a loser, he’s fat (he’s 190 lbs and 5’9, so he’s definitely not obese), he was arrested, he’s poor, he’s stupid for still being unemployed, he’s balding, his parents hate him, etc. Nothing she says is true. She constantly talks about the “abusive” situation I’ve put myself in and she “can’t wait” until I come to my senses. Sometimes it’ll be after she asks about my future plans and I’ll mention him as part of them (because he will be...) and she’ll just respond with “I don’t want to hear about your shitty subpar boyfriend”. Sometimes it’ll be out of the blue texts or calls of “have you left that loser yet?”. It’s exhausting.

She’ll talk on and on about her husband and how she wants a baby now (her husband wants to wait a few years) but if I point that out she tells me to fuck off. The second I bring up my boyfriend I get an aggressive (or passive aggressive) response: the comments above, heavy sighs, comments of “I don’t hate him I just think he’s a loser and you could do better”. I can’t do this.

He has done nothing to her but be kind. He tries to ignore it best he can but it’s starting to affect our relationship. He’s a good person who makes me happy and I want to spend my life with. But I don’t want my sister to hate him. I’ve tried to get my parents or other siblings to step in and try to put a stop to it but all they say is that we’re adults and can handle it ourselves.

TL;DR: my sister hates and constantly harasses my boyfriend. How do I get her to stop?",relationships
"I've been flirting hard with a guy I met online (virtually and remotely, of course) and I thought we struck gold romantically. We're several weeks into getting to know each other. We had a really fiery connection and we've talked nonstop over these past few weeks. We'd talk on the phone for several hours at a time or even just message each other back and forth all day long. I would say our exchanges were certainly a bright spot in my day.

However, my fling just confessed to me that he's been in a years-long open relationship with his girlfriend, and they haven't really established clear boundaries. He didn't think we'd ever get as close as we did and he fell hard for me, but now he feels guilty about the relationship he already has with his girlfriend and the one he's solidifying with me. They're also often jealous of each other, and I don't know how to feel about this. To me, it doesn't sound like they were ready for an open relationship. It might sound great in fantasy, but I think execution-wise, they hadn't quite figured out their boundaries. He said he's been wanting to break up with her for awhile, but he's too scared to do so.

They had an agreement where if one partner met someone, they would ideally tell the other about it. However, my fling was hesitant to tell his girlfriend about me because he felt guilty for whatever reason. I think he knew it would hurt her emotionally. Now, I get the vibe that my fling doesn't really want to talk to me anymore because it's been such an emotional wreck for him. For the past week, his replies have been so laconic and just completely lacking in substance. He's not putting in the work to maintain the spark we've ignited. I'm really upset about it. Now I just keep on checking my phone waiting to receive any word from him.

So many things now make sense about our relationship. He only called me whenever he was driving in his car or taking a walk/running errands. He would also dial me whenever he was in his music studio, purportedly alone recording stuff. I can only assume that he lives with his girlfriend, but I'm not quite sure. He's never called me from home.

I am upset he didn't me he was in an open relationship upon first meeting. Now, I feel like he's about to ghost. 

Can someone please give me some advice? Should I just move on from this fling? Should I give him a chance?

"Are these red flags?

TLDR: What do you think about people that text all day and you haven’t even met in person yet? 

I (F30) have been chatting with someone (M29) on WhatsApp who I met on OkCupid he’s one year younger than me and likes to text all day. I’m not comfortable with talking on the phone just yet so we are mostly texting he also sends me voice notes. I never send him any. But he’s always texting and the moment I reply he replies back instantly and this can go on all day. 

It is a distraction tbh. I have stopped replying to his text I only reply like 2 or 3 times per day to make it look good and not hurt his feelings. 

I have never been in a relationship before so is this normal?",relationships
"For reference i’m 19f and so is my friend. So my friend hates confrontation and has this bad habit of making up elaborate lies instead of just telling the truth. For example, she constantly does this thing where she will blow off our plans and just ignore me, or when i ask to hang out she’ll make up lies instead of just saying she already has plans. Like one day we had plans and i was asking her if we were still on and she hung out with someone else instead, took me off her snapchat story so i couldn’t see them hanging, and then made up a lie the next day saying she got busy. 

Usually this just pisses me off and i get over it, but today was the last straw. I asked her if she wanted to come over and hang out and she said that she hurt her back and needed to rest and that we could hang monday. So i was like ok get better. Then a couple hours later i see her on one of her other friends story on snapchat kayaking at some park. So instead of just saying she had plans she made up a lie. Then right after i saw the girls story on snapchat, the girl unadded me. They did this so i wouldn’t see they were all together. One of my other friends was with them and i’m sure she was in on it too. My friends bday is in 9 days and i was planning on throwing her a party at my college apartment. I told her we could have a party and we were gonna plan it monday. I don’t really think she cares that much and i knew i was gonna end up doing all the work and putting in a lot of effort. After today I don’t really want to talk to her and my other friend that much. 

I want her to apologize but i don’t think she ever will. She knows i’m mad because i sent her the friends story of them kayaking and asked if her back was still hurting. I know she saw my message but she probably won’t reply and then will reply tomorrow and act like everything is normal. I don’t feel like i should have to put in the majority of effort in the relationship. I texted her about how i felt and she just tried to make up more lies. i said “so i saw you kayaking w chloe on lindsey’s story when you told me your back was hurting and you wanted to rest. i don’t know what i did to make you feel like you have to lie when you have plans with other people. if you just tell me you have plans i won’t care, but i don’t know why you always lie about it. this isn’t the first time it’s happened, and it confuses me every time because i don’t know what i did wrong.” And she replied with “when i hang w other people i didn’t know i had to say something to you about it, chloe linds &amp; i hung out for a few hours, i was laying down the whole time bc of my back, then i went back home to rest.. i didn’t lie about anything bc it wasn’t even planned yet, they asked if i wanted to join (after we ft and i took a bath btw) &amp; i didn’t think it was a big deal.. if you thought i was ditching you or something i wasn’t, we hang out more than i hang w anyone else &amp; were even taking ab later in the week, idk why you’re saying “i’ve lied” bc i don’t have a reason to? im assuming it’s times like yesterday that my plans werent even made yet.” I’m just confused bc i never said she had to tell me when she had plans with other people, i literally don’t care. I just don’t understand why she blows me off or pretends like she doesn’t have plans. I don’t want to cut her off because she is a very close friend of mine. Please give any advice on how i should handle this.

TL;DR- my friend basically says she doesn’t have plans and is resting but then hangs out w people and tries to stop me from seeing it. Or she blows off plans we have and hangs w other people and takes me off her story so i can’t see.",relationships
"I’ve been with my boyfriend a year and a half, this is our first serious relationship. He is absolutely great to me, he tells me he loves me so much, he is so loyal and faithful to me, he compliments me constantly, he takes me out, he was excited for me to meet his friends and family etc. 

But lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m not good enough for him. I know I’m pretty and I know I have a good body, but I don’t believe it. Lots of people tell me, and my boyfriend gets annoyed at the fact that I don’t believe him. I know I’m not unattractive, but I can’t see myself as attractive. 

I’m one of them girls that seems like they like to get hurt. A thought popped into my head that my boyfriend will think other girls are pretty. So I asked him and he said he think there are some girls that are equally as pretty as me, but not better, and he isn’t attracted to them the same way he is with me. Obviously, this upset me. I said ok to him and that was it, I didn’t get angry or annoyed bc I know that is not a healthy reaction. A little while ago, I was shit talking a girl he used to date, saying that she had a really bad ass (jealousy is really ugly on me) and he got annoyed and said that she had a good ass. He only defended her bc she was a nice girl and things ended well with them and I was being really mean about her body. But that still made me feel bad about myself again. I set myself up to feel bad about myself but I can’t stop. 

I need to know how to stop feeling so mediocre/just like another attractive girl to him. He will never cheat and we are planning on being together a long time, so it’s not like I have a feeling he will cheat or leave me, I just feel like I’m not good enough. He is so attractive and I see girls flirt with him all the time (he is always very non-tolerant of this and shuts it down instantly) and I just can’t help but think “what if he thinks she is prettier/funnier/kinder/more fun than me?” 

I’m not insecure about myself, but I am when it comes to my relationship. How can I shake this?

"TL;DR: how does one cope with another’s depression whilst keeping sane myself? 

Hi all, hope you’re all well today. 

So here’s the story, I was in a long term relationship up until last year, 9 years long, it was a sad parting but a long time coming. After the relationship naturally I put myself on the dating market and did surprisingly well, to start with I had very low confidence in myself due to my previous relationship, didn’t feel particularly attractive as my ex wasn’t very affectionate towards me and we didn’t have much of a sex life. 
So putting myself out there I actually got a very satisfying response, dated a few girls and I actually learned a lot about myself that I did not realise or suppressed for a long time. Anyway, moving on.
I met an unbelievably attractive girl through online dating, I am not joking when I say she is the most beautiful person I have ever seen. Legitimately she is the closest woman to a 10 in my mind and we hit it off like neither have ever felt before. Our first date was even on valentines unintentionally and we have more in common with each other than anyone I’ve ever met. Everything feels a bit dreamy at the moment and it is difficult to give a shit about anything but her. I have never felt so attracted &amp; connected to someone like this before, I’ve never been so sure of wanting someone like this before and if I’m honest it has been super intense. 
Now her story in a bit of a shortened version, she suffers with depression, so much so that she was on the verge of killing herself before I came along. She even purchased the rope. She has had some unfortunate people in her life from her dad walking out on her at 15 never to be seen again after years of searching for him via social media and she had an abusive relationship that made her feel worthless. 

So we have been seeing each other/light relationship since we first met and it has been absolutely incredible! Our sex is amazing and my feelings towards her make me feel like I’ve never been in love before but it scares the shit out of me and I pretty much have a constant anxiety because in some ways I’m so afraid of losing her that it keeps me from enjoying the present moment but I think maybe due to my own insecurities and her depression. 
I have learned a little about depression in this time and try to understand what to expect from someone that I am coupled up with that suffers from it and I have done very well in giving her reassurance when needed and consistent. 
She often doubts her worth and sometimes questions my intentions, no fault of mine, this is her own struggles and believe me when I say I am trying so damn hard to make her as comfortable, reassured and happy as I can. She is in a really good place right now and I am too, but I am having some struggles. 
This is really hard work on my mind. I know she is the type of person that gets a lot of attention when out and I know she holds the same loyalty as me, but I can’t help but be jealous of absolutely nothing and I don’t know why? She is very popular because of you fantastic personality and stunning looks and I can see just how popular she is when she posts selfies and pictures on social media. It is nice to see because she has such low self esteem but also I know the intentions of a lot of the guys showing her attention or at least so it seems. This is something I’m trying to get over because I know just how stupid and pointless it is to worry about that stuff but right now it is hard to not think about it. I just need some advice on how to curb this horrible emotion and how I should deal with her on her down days so I don’t take it personally? 
I just need to be able to create my own peace of mind a bit.

"Soldier in a 6 year relationship, having issues

A Soldier having love problems

Hello all. I’m 22(M) and my girlfriend is 20(F). I left for Basic Combat Training on February 25th. That would eventually become my biggest regret in life. I had a great time, I met some really cool people who I’m still talking to now. I graduated a week-ish ago. I’m now at my AIT location for the next 5 months. 

When I left home, I was leaving my beautiful state. (Alaska) on top of that, I was going to the opposite side of the country as my girlfriend with very limited and little contact. We have been dating for 6 years this upcoming June 16th. That’s if I can save this relationship. 

During my training, the corona virus hit the world very hard. It caused most people to be locked in their homes, my girlfriend included. She said during this time, she has done more than she has during the six years we have been together. What I (and her) mean is that she has gotten her ears pierced, lost a lot of weight, started smoking weed and drinking heavily, just a whole bunch of stuff. The weight loss, she first said she was doing for me, so that she would look “better” for when she came to my graduation. Quotation marks are because I thought she was beautiful before. 

Halfway through my cycle, they told us they were canceling our family day and graduation. I was a wreck. Each and every day I would wake up, grab a picture of her and give it a kiss before I started my long day. I would do the same before bed. I used her as my motivation to get out of bed and do my absolute best every day. They kept telling us, remember “why” you came here. She is my why. I came here so that once I return we can start our lives together. 6 years is a long time and we were both ready when I left to take the next step. I have plans to propose when I get home, WE have plans on having kids even. 

She didn’t smoke or drink until I left. I thought she would be happy to start talking again after graduation because they give us our phones after we graduate. Instead, she reluctantly told me that she feels that I don’t motivate her enough and she needs to “find herself” and she needs a longer break from me. I’m devastated. There is absolutely no way I can be productive and I’m even having stupid dangerous thoughts in my head because of what she said. I’ve tried talking it out with her but can’t seem to get her to budge. It’s like somebody brainwashed her or something... and before any jokes are made, no she hasn’t cheated on me. Although I’m well aware of the whole military stereotype, it’s just not applicable in this case. 

What can I possibly do to save the one thing I love more than anything in the entire world?

Tl:dr my girlfriend of 6 years has changed feelings after I left for basic training. It’s 100% unjustified and very hurtful. She dropped this on me the day after I graduated and got to my AIT location. What can I do to salvage our once beautiful relationship?",relationships
"My Mum is currently married to my Dad but they are effectively split up despite living under the same roof and still being married to due money issues and the current lockdown. My father will be moving out when it's over although they won't be able to get a divorce because they simply don't have the money to. 

My Mum has been getting very close with a homeless man she met while volunteering at Christmas who apparently is now living with his sister and is not homeless anymore (it's not a fixed address though so technically I guess he is still homeless?) anyway they've been talking a lot, hours a day I would say and I quickly put two and two together despite my mum saying they're friends. When I brought it up she said aren't dating but they have feelings for each other. 

I don't want to nor will I tell my Mum what she can and cannot do but I've tried to express to her that I find it a little strange and just to understand that I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around it a little and that I don't really want to hear about him. I'm 28 after all and he's 32 so I find it a little odd my Mum will likely soon be dating someone barely older than me is all. I guess I also have my reservations on what his motivations and intentions are and why he doesn't want to date someone his own age. I just kind of get the impression he's not that great of guy but she tells me I don't know him like she does. My Mum has definitely been acting a little weird in the last 6 months, akin to that of a mid life crisis but if I mention it she gets very angry and denies it. Infact lately she will only ever seen things her way and will never admit fault for anything but that's a seperate issue. 

Anyway, like I said, I won't tell my mum what she can do or who she can date as I have no right to and I understand her splitting up with my Dad, he hasn't been a good man or husband ever (gambled away £30k plus over the last 20 something years) but I wish my Mum would understand how I feel a little. Visa versa I know for a fact if I started dating a 50 year old woman she would absolutely have something to say about it and would probably judge me.

Just kind of wondering how others would feel about this situation?

"My (f52) husband (m60) (24 yrs in Sept) cannot handle any wrongs or mistakes or adjustments no matter how I approach the subject. 

Yesterday I was going to go buy soil for the nice raised beds he built for me, but he had to but a wheel for his wheel barrow so he said he would buy the soil, so I wrote down they type to get and told him I thought 4-6 bags would do it because I needed extra for some smaller containers. He figured 25% soil from an extra dirt hill in our yard, 25% from a bag of garden soil we already had and the rest raised bed soil. 

That sounded reasonable, but when I went out this morning I only saw 2 bags and thought hr had 2 more somewhere else. Nope. So I filled the beds with what I had and left out the yard soil and the boxes are only half full. 

This would normally not be a problem with most people, but now I have to figure out s way to tell him I need 2 or 3 more bags which I'm happy to go get myself, or he can if he wants to, but what is going to happen is it's going to become a huge thing where he goes to catastrophic thinking about himself. He's a shitty husband, I'm mad at him for not getting enough soil, he ruined Mother's Day, etc are all the places his mind goes. Mainly, it is ""You are unhappy because of me."" It doesn't matter how I phrase it, what my tone is or anything. Knowing what his response will be, I could use ideas.

"We’ve been together for 9 years next month, lived together for 8.  In the past month or so, she’s been a little distant - often not engaging in cuddles, but we’ve been having sex about the usual amount of time.  Today, I asked her what was wrong and got two main points:

She feels like we want different things.  We’ve always known we’re different people- she’s more adventurous, wants to travel, whilst I don’t mind doing those things I am more than happy doing very little.  I’ve not been good in recent years (following some mental health problems 2013-2015) at doing those sort of things, though.  Something we’ve acknowledged but not fixed.  Anyway - she feels like now we’re getting older, we need to start identifying if that’s an issue or not.

The other half is the main point - she is considering if she loves me only as a friend, often lacking the desire to be physically intimate (cuddling, kissing, hand holding, spooning, sex).  She says she doesn’t know when she stopped wanting these things - and that’s what confuses me most...we’ve recently had times where she’s wanted to cuddle, and sex has been as regular as always.

I’ve asked her what she wants to do - and she’s adamant she doesn’t know if these feelings can be worked through or not.  And neither do I.  My vision is If you’re both willing, anything is possible - but it needs that will.

My main question is: how do we know if they are able to work through?  Or if these feelings are truly going to be in the way of us being happy together?

TL;DR Partner of 9 years told me she thinks we’re different and may only love me as a friend.  How do we find out if these are random doubts and can be worked through, or whether to give up now?",relationships
"Girlfriend and I (both in our 30's) had been dating for 18 months. I started to question if the relationship was moving forward for a number of reasons. Namely, we had great passion but at no point did I feel like we worked as a team or a whole greater than the sum of the parts. At this age, I want a partner and someone to build with. I think she does too but might not know how to get there.

In any event, I broke up with her. This was probably fairly suddenly to her but it was something that was building for a while on my end. We have since started talking again and she let me know that 'she dated' while we were apart. I accepted that and didn't really question it. We are after all allowed to try and move on with our lives.

However, after digging into the issue further, she confessed that she slept with her ex FWB 2 weeks after we had broken up. They saw each other a few more times before me and her decided to give the relationship another try. She also confessed that she had been in contact with this person during our relationship, exchanging texts on a semi-regular basis (once or twice a month according to her).

Even though we were technically broken up, I can't help but feel hurt. She had told me about her prior relationships and mentioned male friends before, but this person never came up. I had no idea that he even existed. She insists that they are 'good friends' and that their communication was always respectful of our relationship. Apparently, they knew each other from HS and reconnected in their 20's and dated for a brief time. The relationship didn't work out but they became each other's 'regulars' on and off for over 10 years now.  By all accounts, they stopped sleeping with each other during the two other relationships she had during that 10+ year span but always returned to each other when they were both single again.

I asked her why she would go back to him so soon after our breakup. We had not even circled back to discuss the issues that led to the breakup (the night of the breakup was more of a fight) and we had been in contact during that period so it's not like it was radio silence on my part.  She said that she had told him about the breakup since he was always able to give her solid dating advice in the past and he told her how he was ready to settle down and wanted to give it real shot with her so she agreed to give it a try but soon realized why they hadn't worked to begin with.

I couldn't believe that she would be ready to get in a relationship with someone else 2 weeks after ending a semi-long term relationship. She's also defending the continued contact with him during our relationship since he is 'just a friend' to her. Friends do come in all forms, however to me you can't say that a steady lover is 'just a friend'. I am perfectly fine with my SO having friends of the opposite sex. Even if it is an ex that they have remained friendly with provided enough time has past that they have formed a solid non-sexual relationship. However, I find her saying someone who was her lover for so long, that she never mentioned to me, that they clearly don't have a neutral relationship from a sexual standpoint, and that she would be open to start a relationship should it be defended as 'just a friend'.

She wants to work things out with us and she has said that she loves me and is not a cheater. I am having a very difficult time reconciling all of this and find myself feeling resentful and angry towards her. Again, I was ok with the idea of her 'dating' during our time apart. If she had met someone new and tried with them I may have felt it was soon but I couldn't fault her. But to fall back to someone that I feel she hid from me and to justify their continued contact by saying 'he's just a friend' does not sit well with me.  Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR girlfriend slept with her long time FWB soon after we broke up. Having a hard time moving past it for reconcilation.  Also, uncomfortable that she maintained contact with this person during our relationship and claims he's a great friend but never mentioned him to me. ",relationships
"quite embarrassing but idk how to french. my ex and I tried a few times but we were both inexperienced so it was quite unpleasant to say the least (whole tongue in mouth, flopping like a fish) I started talking to a guy in college and he’s waaaay more experienced than I am so I got nervous to french him because I knew that I would not have a clue what I was doing. we kissed w/o tongue a few times with some lip biting and kisses around the bod and he also asked to suck on my tongue a few times (probably bc of the lack of tongue action i realize now) which i enjoyed but the semester ended before anything else happened. after talking to some friends I learned that kissing w/o tongue is def not it so I was kind of surprised he didn’t run for the hills after my lack of tongue action. (we were only a thing for a few weeks before we left so maybe it wasn’t that big a deal? idk) I want to be able to french when I see him again so he doesn’t think I’m totally strange, im definitely not opposed to it I just don’t want to embarrass myself. any frenching tips? or ways people kiss that are the best or the worst in your experiences?

"I know everyone will tell me to just move on. But it's not easy, however this guy who is my first sexually partner and yes he still the only one. Found out from his current gf that he cheated on me and her behind me back for almost 5months and with previous gf with about 7months its really drive me crazy, confused and full of anger. But well you can't expect people and control them 100%. I know he is a grown up man 37years old where he need to get his shit together but this is just unfair ( nothing is fair anyway)As i made mistake to trust him too much and ignore my suspicion but now im in this limbo. Well i am agree to walk off and the current gf said she will stay however thats up to her. 

As i tried so hard to comfort him he blocked my whatsapp and forward my call but I still can message him which is strange but he ignore me anyway. 

I can not believe someone who always upset and always demand to be honest and no drama but he is the one who dishonest and create big drama. I still remember he said he really value the honesty but far out.This is the worst breakup n very painful to me. Now everyday I can't stop thinking how and why this possible he seems like nice person and sweet but why is This?

Please anyone who can give me advice it will be very nice any yet i try myself to stay positive and do more activities to stay busy but again this unbelievable thought still there. Thank you

"Im reposting from relationship_advice. Also this will be a long post so catch the TLDR at the bottom. 

I(F 20) have been in my first relationship with my boyfriend(M 24) who we’ll call C for a little more than 6 months. We met at a college bar, made out on the dance floor and agreed to become fwb. At first this was fine as I wasn’t experienced and just enjoyed hooking up but I caught feeling and brought them up about a month in. At first C was hesitant and took a few days to think but then agreed to be in a relationship and see where things went. Now here’s the thing, he is not originally from the U.S and his family are conservative so being seen dating before marriage is taboo. He told me straight up that his friends and mine could know we’re dating but not his parents/family. And for the first bit of the relationship I was ok with this, since I was trying to just go with the flow and enjoy my first relationship and having a boyfriend, but as time goes on and after talking to my family and some friends over the course of the relationship I’m starting to have a lot of doubts about this working. I do love C but when I try to be realistic I can’t picture him telling his parents he’s been dating a white girl, like even after a year or 2 in the future, and Im not ok with that. To make things more complicated, he lives at home and is not in college anymore, he never graduated. He does have a fast food job and does ok but in his culture it’s typical to live with parents until a traditional arranged marriage occurs. All his friends are from the same background and accept this as pretty normal, despite most of them going against their parents wishes in one way or another. He is also immature in a lot of ways. Like sometimes I feel like I'm talking to a 14 year old when I bring up the fact that I want him to tell his parents about us at some point, he just tries to change the subject or says like “I fucked it up” by bringing this stuff up. I don’t consider myself a stupid person, I recognize that some of his behaviors are manipulative, and informed by some toxic facets of his cultural upbringing but yet I’m having a hard time just ending things. Somehow I still feel like there’s enough love to outweigh the bad. The reason I made this post is a fight we got into yesterday when I asked him if he would ever tell his parents about us and he said no, and I told him I was upset by that. He basically said I knew that going into the relationship and he feels like I’m being “brainwashed” by my family/friends. I saw this as bullshit and told him as much. After much arguing and getting no where really, we stopped talking on an unsure note. This morning I texted him to see what’s up and he was acting cold and talking as if we we’re breaking up or he wanted to, but when he FaceTimed me later and I asked if he wanted that, he said why would you think he wants to break up because he never said those words. I feel like I’m going crazy sometimes like his logic and the way he says things just don’t make sense. Then later we talked about telling his parents again and I was crying and he was picking at a pimple in pain, so I jokingly said good you’re in pain because I was still upset but clearly not serious. He then asked if I wanted to see him hurt and I said as a joke yes but it was obviously not serious but then he said ok I’ll cut my finger with a razor to make you happy. I told him he was crazy and to stop because I don’t want that of course but then he actually did it. It was only a very small finger cut but still bleeding a bit  I was in shock and we stopped FaceTime soon after. Now he’s just acting like normal again, with his family, smiling and I’m just in shock like I feel like either I’m going crazy. To be frank I don’t know what to do at this point and I’m just shocked that the person I love could act like this. 

TLDR; me( F 20) and my boyfriend(M 24) argued over him telling his conservative foreign parents about us and then he cut himself with a razor( only a small finger cut) because it would “make me happy” to see him hurt. He’s acting normal now but IDK how to proceed.",relationships

About a year ago I cheated on my gf. We managed to work through it but she sometimes struggles with anxiety about it happening again. I want a normal social life and for me this means going for drinks with colleagues a couple of times a month. 

It usually involves staying out late when we all have the day off the next day. What can I do to make my girlfriend feel a bit more relaxed about these events?

I've invited her along but this is not possible due to her curfew. I don't like texting her throughout the night because it distracts from the fun I'm having socialising and playing pool. I hoped the anxiety would start to ease up a bit after all this time and after so many of these events but it doesn't seem to be improving. 

How can I best support her?

"Hi y'all, 
My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and have been for about a year. I moved in with her just before our country entered lockdown. She has been extremely depressed as a result of not being able to see her friends and being unable to work. 

This manifests itself in feelings of inadequacy on her part and makes her insecure and paranoid. I will just be interacting with her normally and she will feel condescended or patronised. 

She won't talk to me or interact with me at all once she's in one of these moods, which she is at least every other day. It usually ends with me apologising for making her feel this way and explaining I wasn't condescending her at all.

I'm really not sure how to cope with this anymore. I'm just existing and she'll suddenly feel attacked?  I'm constantly tiptoeing around her incase she takes something the wrong way. What the fuck do I do here? She admits that afterwards she realizes I wasn't actually condensing her and that she's just depressed and insecure but that doesn't stop it happening again in the future. Of course I understand to an extent. The world is stressful at the moment but I'm not taking it out on her.

Edit for clarification: I don't even have to say anything to set this off, if could be a look I allegedly give her or the way I walk or just any small meaningless thing 

TL;DR girlfriend is depressed due to isolation and is taking  it out on me by being paranoid about how I treat her. As a result is treating me like shit",relationships
"So here’s the story: 

it’s going to make the guy sound really bad but I know deep down he’s a good person. 
I also know that he’s someone emotionally unavailable and I’ve never understood why. 

So I met this guy when I was 19-20 working at a child care facility. Had an enormous crush on him since I first laid eyes on him, it’s something I have literally never in my life experienced with anyone else. Anytime he would say anything to me or even just look in my general direction, I’d get so excited. Every cheesy romantic movie about high school crushes - trust me, I was that giddy. 

We hooked up many times, each and every time was spectacular. The best sex I have ever had. In person, he treats me amazingly, makes conversation, wants to get to know me, laughs at my jokes etc etc. We bond over video games and other things and I could just tell we would be friends for a long time. I never really thought of him as someone I could date because he went to school really far away from me at the time. Also never once went on a date. Another thing I noticed is that he barely texted me, and was bad at communicating outside of personal interactions. I have always been OK with this because I also hate texting constantly and I’m terrible at keeping up with people. Everyone else I know that knows him says the same, he’s a terrible texter, so i knew it wasn’t just me. He asked me once if I liked him, and because I wanted to play along with the whole casual vibe of things I said no. 

All the while, I went through phases of really liking him to hating him because I felt we only over met up to catch up and have sex. But i liked the FWB setup and was okay knowing that that’s all it would be. But then one day he’d message me again and i’d get all the feelings all over again. constant cycle. 

years passed and we both got busy with other things, he attends law school and has a rigorous schedule, which I was proud of him for and knew all about it. He even told me to come visit him once and sit in on a class, which never happened because I was too shy and thought he was kidding. 

When we’d talk, it wasn’t  only be sex related I mean we talk about everything! At some point last year I felt I had gotten over him somewhat and was able to continue the friendship, and we’d have heart to hearts about girls in his life/guys in my life etc. All the while always wanting to hook up. But at some point he’ll always stop responding and when he does I feel awful. and if I bring it up to him he just says he’s busy and I feel I don’t have a right to be upset about it since all we are is friends. I’ve never told him about my feelings. But I have dreams about this guy regularly, and have fantasized about what it would be like to be his gf. sometimes I’ve even convinced myself that I’m secretly the one he’s going to end up with because otherwise why would we have stayed in contact for so long? He’s also never really dated anyone seriously in the time I’ve known him. I know this is crazy and I know it needs to stop but I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to unfollow him on social media, he rarely posts anyways. 

TL;DR 
Ive been in love with this guy for the past 4 years who barely gives me attention but then when he does he’s the most amazing guy. I’ve had feelings for him for years and I don’t know how to get him out of my mind. Any kind of social media interaction I get from him makes my whole entire day, my blood rushes to my face and my heart beats fast. I’ve never told him I have feelings and I feel like it would ruin the decent friendship we have. He’s ruined relationships of mine simply because I can’t get him out of my head. Advice?
Also, I feel i’m addicted to his sometimes lack of attention because I’m so used to getting attention from men that I date that it’s almost like a challenge to get his attention. Crazy I know.",relationships
"In the beginning of our relationship she was very scared that I would cheat on her and took extreme measures to catch me out, liking going through my phone, randomly showing up outside my building trying to see inside my window. There was nothing there for her to find, but this seemed to fuel her paranoia further. I did what I could to support her, I even gradually let myself lose touch with most of my female friends, I deleted Snapchat, etc. 

Eventually we moved to the other side of the country for a fresh start. That is when we began living together. I thought the problems would go away, that she would surely trust me more if she was living with me and could see what I was up to. In fact the opposite happened, we argued more frequently than ever. I grew suspicious of her also during this time, after her confession that she frequently thought about cheating on me to 'get even,' and had even planned on doing so but never went through with it.

That was over a year and a half ago. Since then our schedules have been busier and things have been healthier, however we are now quarantining together and our issues are harder to avoid. I noticed that she became very protective about her phone, particularly her Snapchat. She was hyper-cautious using it in front of me and would position herself carefully so her screen was out of sight. After several weeks of this, she mentioned that she had met a guy from our country on Reddit, they had become friends and were planning on meeting up after the pandemic. 

I took her word for it that he was just a friend but I was still bothered by her secrecy. Every time I would enter the room she would be on her phone typing really fast, before quickly closing everything when I sat down, and she would take her phone with her to the bathroom where I would here her sitting and typing also. She turns her sound off but has nails so it is hard not to notice in a small apartment. 

I also noticed she had many pictures in her gallery where she was done up in makeup and pushing her boobs out as if posing for someone. She said that she only takes those pictures for herself and hadn't sent them to anybody. 

I have no proof of anything, only my gut feeling that something is very wrong. Two nights ago after noticing another small lie I finally worked up the courage to ask her about it. I told her I wasn't accusing her of anything but I wanted to know why she was being so cautious about Snapchat. At first she acted like she didn't know what I meant. But after I gave some examples of what she was doing she admitted that yes she had done all of those things but didn't know why. 

That didn't make any sense to me. She fully acknowledged that she was acting shady but offered no explanation. She offered to let me see her Snapchat and said she would be more open about these things in future. I said that I didn't want to see her phone, I just wanted her to look me in the eyes and tell me what the problem is so that we can figure it out together. I promised not to be angry or judge her.

She then said that she has been talking to another guy from our country, they met on Skype a long time ago and lost touch. She seen that he was online a few months back and messaged him, they became friends again. She insisted that he is a ""manwhore"" and she isn't interested in him. I asked why she was hiding him from me, she claimed to be worried how I would react. I pointed out that this doesn't make sense as she has many male friends whom I have never had an issue with. She didn't have an answer to that so I let it go. 

She offered to show me her Snapchat again about half an hour later and this time I agreed. There wasn't anything to see in her conversation with either of the two guys, the first was just music they had sent each other and the other was blank except for one recent snap. 

I felt like an idiot and went quiet for a while. She asked if I was talking to anybody and I said no, the only person was this girl from Reddit who I chatted with about art and music for a few weeks. 

Well, she blew up, began crying and asking questions about her. I simply showed her the WhatsApp chat and let her read through it, she couldn't find anything even remotely flirty but continued to cry and pull away from me. While this was happening I comforted as best I could. After she had calmed down we continued to talk. Up until now I had believed her somewhat until she changed her story again. Apparently all of the shady behaviour is just because she is trying to catch me cheating, she admitted to checking my online status on each account every time I would leave the room.

This brought me back to the beginning of our relationship when she would do things like this all the time. I thought she had stopped but I guess she just got better at hiding it. But by now her story has changed twice and I felt like she was not telling me the whole truth. By this point she was crying again so I spent the night comforting her and didn't bring up my doubts. She mentioned one other thing though which is really bothering me, and that is that she still often thinks about cheating on me to ""get even."" And apparently much of her fear and anger comes from a dream she had where we had a threesome and I paid more attention to the other girl.

For the last few weeks I have felt as though I was dying inside, the uncertainty was killing me. But after this conversation I am convinced that there is zero trust left in our relationship. I still don't know whether or not she cheated on me but I no longer care, all I know is that this is not somebody who I can rely on as a partner. 

I hope somebody can offer some perspective or advice on this that will help me. What should I do? I feel so alone here and have no family to turn to right now.

"So my boyfriend (m22) and I (f26) are coming up on our one year university, and I'm having a lot of doubts. We met through work about 3 years ago, but started dating after I moved onto a new job. This start of our relationship was magical... We had many shared hobbies and our personalities clicked so well. We both had really outgoing personalities and similar humor, and both of us could talk forever.

Now 3 months ago he suggested I move in with him to see if we could be a good match long-term. It felt soon but it also felt very right so I jumped in, it didn't help that at 26 and still living with parents, this seemed like a good oppurtunity to move out. 

So present day, I think we moved in way too quickly and I hate living with him. Anytime hes irritated or upset with me he ignores me for hours... Like I will talk at him and he will turn around and sit in silence, for hours, maybe even overnight. He's also jealous, anytime I go out with friends of any gender... And claims it's because im not giving him enough affection so he gets jealous. At my age.... I'm so done with this, it seems immature. I've tried to explain it but he says he will change he just needs me to show I love him. I'll admit that i'm not that affectionate... But I told him before and ot was never a issue before.

I really want to call it quits, but I feel so guilty. He's very set on me being the only woman he's been with, and he mentions that if we break-up it'll destroy him. He told me before he was severely depressed and refused to leave him home for months. That before he even met me but he alludes that he could go back to that if anything ever happens.

It's not that I don't want to be with him, I honestly just want to move back home... But I think I just need to hear another perspective on this situation. I'd rather not leave and embarrass him and make things more difficult, but I'm fully eating one edible a day to get me through this, otherwise I am always irritated and act coldly.

"I (22F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (22M) for almost 3 years now. We've been quarantined together and some things about him started to annoy me really bad. He doesn't take care of himself like he used to, he showers once a few days or once a week, he doesn't brush his teeth if I don't tell him to, he's on the computer almost all day and he doesn't do almost anything around the house. I told him that and he said that if I wanted help with my chores (we separated the to do's in the house) I should just ask. But I would like for him to just do his more often and without me telling him. 

Also I feel like he gets angrier than before when I point out something he does that annoy me, and when he gets angry it's kinda bad. He hits and bites himself and screams and this shit is scary for me. I also have a short temper, especially lately, and I start screaming too when he says something I disapprove with and I hate this. 

I mean when we get along it's really nice, but when we fight, I just wish I'd break up and leave. I also feel weird being intimate with him, I don't feel the need at all and always try to postpone it. Even with kissing. And I also feel like I need his approval to do things, because we often have different opinions on things, but also he's been right about a lot of stuff in my life and made my life better. So that's why I'm a little bit scared to make my own choices. 

I always felt like he is a little bit controlling and he admitted that but he also tried to change and he's better than before. But still I don't find myself that happy in the relationship. He's over all a good guy and he's been with me through a lot of shit and helped me get out but I somehow don't want to be with him anymore. But when I think about it I start feeling scared and jealous and I know I'd hurt him really much and I don't know why but I feel like I'd hurt myself too, even if I don't want him anymore. I also feel like I won't find anyone better because he understood and understands me a lot, he's been there for me and he still is, even with his flaws. My family loves him too. 


I'm just confused, I have contradictory thoughts and now it's hard for me, especially with the sex, but I feel like it would be harder without him. Really don't know what to think or what to, I just want to be free, but I know that if I choose that we both will be hurt. We've been together and lived together for so long that I feel like I don't know who I am without him.

My (23M) younger brother (21M) has always been a loud guy who marches to the beat of his own drum. Before the virus hit, he was the type of guy you find drinking heavy, going to the bars, smoking cigarettes and sleeping around. He's a little bigger so he fits the bill of a typical young bar chad, but underneath the extra on top, he has a good intentions and I usually don't bother him about the way he lives his life.

After the virus came and his lease expired, he moved back into our house with my mom (54F) who is getting on in her years and is frustrated enough with having to work online. My brother likes to toy with my mom and bait her into arguments which always leads to shouting, gaslighting and made-up facts. He also plays obnoxiously loud music in shared spaces of the house, calls my mom by her first name (or just ""woman"") for fun and curses anytime he feels like it. My mom shrugs most of this off, especially since he's never serious and he's been ""her baby"" ever since he was young, but his behavior is clearly wearing on her.

For the first week of him moving back he was fairly mellow and I was optimistic, but when his birthday came the obnoxiousness was full-blow. He got drunk during the day and was hanging around the house blasting his music and walking around in his underwear (this is his mom's house). He requested a special dinner that myself and my mom bought and prepared, only to leave to be with his friends who were getting together despite social distancing.

I've tried to reason with him in the past about the way he behaves, but he's made it clear that he isn't going to change. So I've tried to accept him for who he is since I want him in my life, but the way he treats my mom makes me uneasy since I know it's not good for her health. I feel bad for my brother since he's been antagonized his whole life and has gotten the short end of the stick many times, but I don' t know if that justifies him being as inconsiderate as he is...what should I do? Any advice would be appreciated.

"Throwaway account. I want to give some context about this issue, so let's start at the beginning. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible, but I may be missing some details. I really think this is a complex issue.

I've been in a relationship for 8 months and things have been going well, up until the quarantine started. Since then, we have been unable to meet up in person (we both live with our parents), work for my girlfriend has transitioned to the home environment, and our main form of communication has turned into texting each other. At first, I felt like I could adjust to this change. I think I was doing pretty well for the first 1-2 weeks. However, I noticed that our communication had harshly declined (to the point where we could go through a day without really saying anything to each other). I decided to talk to her about it and told her that I felt like our lack of communication was really bothering me and that I wanted the both of us to message each other more often. This conversation went well and she said she would try her best to communicate with me more. She admitted that she wasn't doing the best job in communication and was prioritizing other things (such as spending time with siblings and work).

Fast forward to a couple of days later and nothing has really changed. I know she has a life of her own and I should respect the time that she has for herself, but at this point, I feel really irrelevant in her life. I'm met with one word responses to conversation starters or even just being flat out ghosted in messages sometimes. There isn't even an exchange of a good morning or good night unless I decide to say it first. Thus, I decided to talk to her about it again. However, this conversation was vastly different. She told me that she felt like she communicated with me enough and that I was being too clingy. I was told that thinking about her all the time was unhealthy and that I should be using my friends as a coping mechanism for my loneliness. This honestly hurt a bit since I do talk to my friends regularly, I simply wanted to talk to her a bit more... I think the both of us got a bit heated, but in the end I said ""fine"".

Now, a couple more days have passed. I was being very spiteful (and in retrospect I know this was the wrong thing to do), but I kept messages with her to a minimum. I spent most of the days with some friends and only gave her one word responses or ghosted her messages. This obviously didn't go so well since she confronted me about it. She told me that I was not solving the problem by distancing myself from her and spending time with my friends (when this is exactly what she told me to do a couple days ago). At this point, I think I blew a fuse. I don't remember the specific details, but I ended up revealing all the things that I did not like about how she was acting. I told her that she was being a hypocrite and that this was a problem that could only be solved if she decided to change, not me. This did not go so well as my girlfriend revealed to me that being my girlfriend felt like a job where I was evaluating her all the time. She was really panicking and stressed out at this point. Thus, she told me that she wanted to take a break from the relationship for three weeks so we could get our bearings together. I obviously refused at first, but she seemed unwilling to continue the relationship until we take this break, so I reluctantly agreed.

During this three week break period, I managed to reconnect with some old friends and find some new hobbies. So, I don't think the break was completely useless. My girlfriend was able to adjust to her work life better and create a good daily schedule for herself. However, I was still a bit salty. I was forced into this break and it really felt like we were running away from this problem. My biggest issue was that the problem might resurface after our break was over.

After this break was over, we started talking again. We set up a daily call in the morning so we could spend that time talking about yesterday. I would always initiate the call to check if she was still sleeping and then if she was sleeping, wake her up. Then, we would have a call with each other. However, in the past couple days, we haven't had any calls. Admittedly, this is because I was tired and overslept. But, she told me that she was awake during that time and was waiting for me to message her. This sort of rubbed me in the wrong way. I wanted to talk to her, but she did not seem to want to put in the effort to call or check up on me. As a result, I felt like she didn't really want to have a call in the first place.

So, yesterday night, I told her that I did not want the morning calls anymore because I felt like I was forcing her to play along with what I wanted. I told her that I put so much effort into our relationship in the early stages, but I'm not met with the same amount of effort. Saying this was a bad idea... She really blew up on me saying how this entire thing is my fault and that I don't understand her. She thinks I'm being really overbearing and putting too much pressure on her. We got into a really heated argument this morning which really scared me. The tone of her voice really made me feel like this was really the end. She told me that I never asked her what she wants and that she doesn't know how to solve whatever ego problem that I have.

That's where the monologue ends. Currently, I don't know how to proceed from here. Breaking up is an option, but I feel it's something that neither of us want (otherwise it would have already happened). What should I do? If there is even a right or wrong, who is right or wrong? Am I being unreasonable for asking for this? I know that the way I dealt with this wasn't the best, so what can I do to improve?

\---------

tl;dr - The lack of communication due to the quarantine has made me feel irrelevant in my girlfriend's life. Talking to her about this has revealed to me that she thinks it's an issue I need to solve myself. Where do I go from here?",relationships
"I still love her and I want to breakup because I feel hurt all the time, Im jealous as frick because It's a long distance relationship, It's such a pain that I still love her but I don't want this, she won't change, we tried countless times, it's like a routine now, she is angry/sad we argue and then we give each other another chance, I just want to end this but I don't wanna be hurt, and I know I will, how do I reduce my feelings towards her so I can freely break up without having to go all through the hard time and just leave. How do I reduce my feelings towards her, so I don't have to feel all that bad, I know she won't be hurt, she always let's me know that I do matter less and I just can't handle it emotionally, how do I just get out of this weird relationship, I really need some help.

I was thinking of just treating her as a friend but, what do I do next?

"Is it weird being sad about missing my friendship with my ex-girlfriend when I'm in a long term relationship? I always try not to think about it but sometimes my emotions gets in the way.

Backstory: I(25F) had this really close friend in high school and then I dated her for 2 years (we were on and off) but we broke up because we became distant and we really lacked communication. We didn't really get to talk about it properly before actually breaking up, our conversations just became shorter and shorter until we didn't talk for months. Although, after months of not talking, we tried talking about what went wrong, but we didn't really know the exact reason why. We never did anything bad to one another. I guess we weren't really compatible in a relationship and we were better off as friends? I am currently dating my boyfriend(26M) for 5 years who is really kind, understanding and reliable. I love him and we've grown so much because of our relationship.

But there are times that I'm being reminded of my ex-girlfriend and I get really sad because we used to be really close friends before we became a thing. I just really feel guilty for feeling the way I feel. I feel guilty for being sad about it. We are still friends (it took us a year to be friends again) but we're not as close as we were before being in a relationship.I guess I'm just really missing the times when we were each other's go-to person and we could open up about anything but because of the fact that we were exes, I felt it made everything awkward? It really sucks losing a bestfriend because of a relationship that didn't work out. Sigh

It was never a ""What if we were still together?"" 
It was more of ""What if we just remained as friends from the start?"" 
Maybe we would still be as close as we were before. Maybe we would have saved our friendship. 


TL;DR I have a long term and healthy relationship with my boyfriend and I feel bad for being sad about missing my friendship that my ex-girlfriend and I had before we became a thing.",relationships
"I (19M) have a small bug with my girlfriend (18F). She used to be really good friends with a guy, and then he caught feelings for her and she rejected him. The other day, during a random conversation, the topic of snap streaks came up. I asked her if I was the highest streak just out of curiosity, and she said no. I asked who was her highest streak, expecting it to be one of her best friends, but it was the guy who previously caught feelings for her. Theres a few things that concerned me about finding this out. 1. I didn't know she had such a large streak with him 2. When I asked her who it was she said how long the streak was for and didn't say the name of the person, making me lead up with the question asking who it was, and she was then a little hesitant to tell me it was him 3. Personally, I would never date a girl that has a really close guy friend (you can tell me thats stupid all you want, but I've never seen a friendship between a guy and a girl where one of them did not eventually catch feelings, so thats just a stress I will never want to deal with in a relationship no mater the people involved) and I'm worried that it will respawn the friendship, and I would be very uncomfortable with that.

She has told be before that the ""bridge with him is burned"", and I question that statement based on the fact that they have communicated every day for such a long time.

I am concerned to bring up this concern with her because the last thing I want to be in the relationship is controlling. Am I overreacting? Should I bring it up with her? What should I do?

tl;dr My girlfriend has a long snap streak (much longer than mine with her) with a guy that caught feelings with her a while back, and it makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to seem controlling.",relationships

Lately she's been getting more distant, not remotely interested in anything I try to show her, we've been getting in alot of shouting matches lately  and she thinks I'm the bad guy and I think she's the bad guy. She's been getting very bossy trying to tell me what to do and whenever I bring up the fact that she's being bossy, she says that they are just suggestions and when I said cool, sometimes I say no. She starts to say things like I don't love her or want her which isn't even close to the truth. Right now I work a job that I really don't like and im looking at finding a new job working from home due to the pandemic and she gets angry with me when I say that I want to find a job thats a better fit for me. She critsizes my career choices and accuses me of being a quitter whenever I want a different job. Its like that saying ""I'm rubber you're glue, whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks on you"". Whenever I try to talk to her about my feelings  she blames me instead.

"Oh boy so here it goes... My wife and I have been married since valentines day last year. We got married too quickly... 8 months after we started dating. There were so many red flags in the beginning. So many things that were wrong.

 After we got married there were times when things got much worse. I got use to being called names. Every little move I made was a mistake I would be screamed at multiple times a day. She would tell me I cant do anything right. At the same time it's like ive been her servant. If she wanted anything done she would always ask me to do it. I would have to clean the house, do dishes, laundry, etc. Then she would turn around and be so sweet. It's so confusing. She would wonder why I never wanted to have sex or be intimate with her.

 A few months ago things got worse and she was constantly looking through my phone. She would look through it when I was asleep or just take it out of my hands. She would argue with me if I wanted to not be up her ass constantly. I couldnt go outside, couldnt take a bath, couldnt be on the phone longer than a certain amount of time. There was just so much control. I go exhausted. I told her I didnt want to be married anymore. I ended up going to a hotel for a few days and she was ALWAYS texting me and calling me even though I told her I needed space. One day she calls and I am drunk. She says shes coming to get me and I tell her no but she says shes coming anyway. I panicked and overdosed on pills because I was fucked up and not making good decisions at the time. 

After that I came home a few days and of course shes acting so sweet and everything. She swears shes going to get better now and shes in therapy but I'm so done. I'm not in love with her anymore. I wish she would leave. I feel trapped in my own apartment. She wont accept the marriage is over. I told her that her forcing me to give her another chance wasnt going to help things and she told me ""well if you would just give me another chance I wouldnt have to force you."" Shes acting like the relationship is already getting better because were sleeping in the same bed and I have my wedding ring on. I sleep in the same bed with her because she begged me for two hours to sleep in there with her and cried and whined. I finally gave in. She also made me feel bad about not wearing the damn ring. I dont know what to do anymore. I want out of my marriage.

I've opened up to him before and he's been really kind about it and has listened. He's never been one to show emotions at all though.

I'm concerned for him because this week his grandpa passed away and didn't want to tell me, now he's always out of the house at his garage next to his work because he refuses to be home.

Last night he slept in his pickup truck in the garage by his work, and told me that ""I'm good, don't worry about me."" He now cancelled his day plans to go up north and work on a buddy's car, that he was so excited for, without giving me reasoning. Hes being kinda dry too...

I don't wanna seem crazy or too attached but I'm really concerned for him and I don't know how to help him or what to do!? He's told me he doesn't wanna tell me his problems because he doesn't want me to worry, but I already am lol.

"My wife is OCD, has panic disorder and may be a side of hoarding. We have an almost 2 year old son. My issue is that I feel like she cannot maintain a safe environment for him at home despite being a stay at home mom. The home currently looks like a scene out of a hoarder TV show. Walkways only with stuff piled against the walls.

I have tried countless medications, therapists and doctors visits. Nothing has helped.

At this point, I fear for the safety of our child. I fear that he will trip and hurt himself. I fear he will find something he shouldn't.

My issue is that, I keep getting glimmers of hope. New doctors. New ideas to try. The newest idea is to have someone come into our home, a professional organizer ($30/hr) to help her learn to clean properly. We're on a waiting list for a new psychiatrist team.

I told myself I would be done if she couldn't get better with ERP. She failed out of that due to the panic disorder, which was discovered.

Part of me feels guilty, I love her and want to help her get better. But I'm getting burned out. I'm tired of her telling me that she can clean the home (she can't).

I'm torn. I want to raise my son in a clean, safe and healthy environment. I worry about lasting psychological damage due to the overly cluttered environment. I also don't want him to grow up in a broken home.

"A little background: 

My (25 F) boyfriend (26 M) is Sikh. I guess I'd be considered as non-religious/agnostic. We live in the southern U.S. We’re also an interracial couple (I’m white, he’s Indian). There are a lot of traditional views on marriage/sex etc. in Sikhi, but we discussed before we began the relationship and he made it clear that he didn’t have a problem with sex before marriage within a serious relationship. Also probably relevant, but there has been some tension between me and his family over me being non-Sikh.

What happened:

So recently I moved in with him during quarantine. His oldest brother (31 M, he’s a strict, baptized Sikh and very traditional) found out about this and completely flipped out about the fact that we're living together and having sex outside of marriage. He called my boyfriend (with me in the room) and told him that I’m making him act like this and that I’m a distraction and that I’m only with him for sex and his money. Basically saying I’m distracting him from his faith and that I’m the one who’s convincing him that it’s okay. My boyfriend did side with me and defend me but I felt really awful that he was being put in that position between me and his family.

His brother then called me afterwards (we have an okay relationship but we’re not that close at all) and he told me basically the same thing in a very lecturing/confrontational way and it was completely uncomfortable. Just saying he knows that I'm pushing this on him and basically that I'm a bad influence and pushing him in the wrong direction and implying that I'm coercing him into sex and thinking this is okay (as if my bf isn't a 26 yr old grown man!) It was extremely awkward. I defended myself but I didn't want to cause anything to blow up anymore than it was so I held back for the most part. 

But then to top it all of, he's childishly threatening to tell their parents. So this has obviously caused a lot of tension and stress for my boyfriend and I hate that I'm causing all of this. He's been apologizing to me because of how his brother is acting and is super embarrassed but he also loves and respects his brother a lot, so I know this is hard for him.

His brother also texted me this morning and told me to ""Think about what I said"" and I really don't appreciate him talking to me like that but I'm also a very non-confrontational person and this is making me feel so awkward and uncomfortable. I also understand that religion is very important to him and I respect that and I'm actually open to converting to Sikhi, but I think he went too far when he started questioning my character and placing blame on me. Also I just feel he definitely could have handled it in a much more respectful way.

Right now everything's really tense. My bf doesn't know if he's going to make this an even bigger deal and tell his parents or how they'd even react and he's just super stressed that his brother is acting like this. And I really just don't want to get in between them or stir up family drama, but I don't know what to do and I really don't want it to affect our relationship.

Tldr; My bf's very traditional religious brother doesn't think we should live together before marriage/have premarital sex because of their religion and says that I'm distracting his brother from the religion and that it's all my fault he's making these choices. He confronted me on the phone about it in a very confrontational and rude way. He's also threatening to tell their super traditional parents that we're living together. How can I deal with this or calm down the situation?",relationships

How long should I wait? And is this a really bad thing to do?

"Context: my boyfriend hasn't got a good relationship with his parents. Over our relationship (6+ years) they have gradually taken to contacting me as a way to stay in his life. Whenever they want to know how he is, or have to tell him or organise something they message me, not him. This is inconvenient and irritating but for really important family stuff they exchange emails.

He went back to his hometown to attend a funeral and his mum [F55] sprang him a visit AT THE FUNERAL without giving him notice, making a huge scene about how much she wanted to see him again. He was so angry about having his boundaries crossed so intensely (while grieving the sudden death of his friend), I don't think they left on good terms.

Anyway, his mum has more recently been commenting on all my Instagram photos (of sunsets, plants, food etc) and replies to almost every story. I think she's trying to compensate for her lack of connection to her son through me, and it's so irritating. 

Now that we've broken up after a long few heart wrenching weeks of discussion and ultimately decision to break ties, this type of interaction is even more awkward since she still thinks were together. I've asked him repeatedly if/when he plans on telling his parents, since they still think we're living together/I'm looking after him. I messaged him to ask if he had a plan to tell his parents; he's going to email them, but no date provided.

Just posting in the hope I'm not alone in dealing with clingy parent types, in particular parents of SO? Apparently he would deal with a lot of messages from her until he eventually blocked her on SM, that's why they only email now. I read a viral tweet saying something about parents overcompensating by being clingy to their children in adulthood for lack of connection previously.

Tldr: my ex's mum keeps interacting with me on Instagram which was annoying before we broke up and awkward as hell now. Do I wait until my ex tells her or set some boundaries now since it's just not okay with me in general?",relationships
"My girlfriend (22F) and I (24M) have been dating for 5 months now. I have this problem where I respond to everything that surprises me with a laugh, even when my girlfriend is opening up to me about something. It's so disappointing because she believes that I'm laughing at her when it's only my primal instinct to laugh. I don't mean any disrespect, in fact I love it when she shares little facets of detail about her. 

I do however need to work on when to laugh and when not to laugh though and I'd love to hear some opinions on this and what I need to do to fix this issue of mine. 

TLDR: 

I need to work on the fact that I laugh whenever my girlfriend shares something about her and this gives her an impression of me teasing her for opening up.

To give you a bit of background my girlfriend has had an abusive past with violence in her childhood but hasn't told me too much as she doesn't like to talk about it and gets upset easily with this topic. She often has nightmares due to this but last night woke up and was really shaken up, hyperventilating and her whole body trembling. I gave her a few minutes to calm down and then gave her a gentle hug. I then offered to go and get her a drink, but she said she wanted to. I thought she would come back but after a while i started to get worried so went into the kitchen to see her standing by the side facing away from me. Just as I started speaking she jumped and dropped the glass sending water spilling everywhere and smashing the glass. She then started to get upset as she tried to clear it all up. She then told me this morning when i asked about it that last night wasnt that bad and that it got so bad that at one point that she was scared to sleep, as the dreams/flashbacks were so real. She is adament against counselling so please don't suggest this, as shes tried this before and said it made her remember a lot of things that she'd forgotten and made everything much worse. I try not to bring anything up as she gets upset easily. Normally she's the confident one so this is very unlike her, ans i was wondering if there's anyone that has experienced anything like this or something similar, as I would love to help her in any way that i can. I really would like advice on how to help calm her down when she wakes up in this state, as whenever i ask she dismisses it saying that it wasn't that bad and that i dont need to worry and that it isn't my fault at all.... any help would be appreciated :)

"I just had flowers delivered for Mother's Day to my inlaws' home. The florist called saying that they aren't home and I told him to leave it at the front door.

They are like this about EVERYTHING. Constantly arguing all the time about every little thing. Also 90\* is objectively hot. Anyone who thinks otherwise has dementia. And I am not a fucking florist who knows how long flowers last; neither are they. I am just telling them what the florist told me.

"For context, I was in a friendship with someone with someone I considered to be a really good friend to me, Sable. When she (23F) started a FWB situation with my ex-boyfriend, Raymond (25M), when we were 19, she started getting very mean. As in I wasn't allowed to visit Raymond's house when I was in town on college break, or Raymond was treated suspiciously when he came up to visit my college campus. Sable also talked about me behind my back, and it eventually ended up with me getting tired of Sable's negative attitude and deciding to cut ties as amicably as possible. I had known Sable for two years before she got involved with my ex-boyfriend and we were really close even if we had our occasional strife and it really hurt me when she started acting like that. I also think I have some trust issues due to various family problems.

Now, I'm really not good at trusting new potential friends because I'm afraid they won't show their true colors until I'm really invested in the relationship, like what happened with Sable. I met some people over Twitter and we share a lot of similar interests and they happen to live in the same town as me.  When I met them for the first time, we got along really well and they invited me to a Twitter group chat which had more people (most don't live in our city, but some have visited our city and we've met up). We hung out a fair amount over July - November of last year, and I don't like that my first thought was ""these people are so nice it's suspicious."" I was invited to various events/Christmas hangouts, but as the new year passed, I stopped being invited to events that happened in our city and I wasn't sure why (even though these events are a common interest of ours). These new Twitter friends also insisted (around Sept) I tell off my ex-boyfriend for sexually harassing me (he was), which ended up causing a major rift in another friendship I had with a girl, Mable (these twitter people also don't like Mable because she didn't say anything when my ex was harassing me). I should note that I really should have told him off earlier, but I put up with it so I wouldn't cause drama. 

These people that live in the same town as me are also close friends with each other (I think they met over Twitter and lived in the same city, surprisingly) and have been for ~2 years so I know that they'll gravitate towards each other mostly. Anyways, I'm usually the person to reach out first, and I know that with quarantine/everything happening, people are acting a bit differently than they usually would, so I'm trying to be understanding. Even so, I almost never get a reply back from these friends (with the exception of one person), even though they talk to each other a lot/do video calls with each other/tweet a lot/etc. Since everything that happened with Sable, I'm really scared of making new friends because I don't know when they'll show their true colors. How do I help myself calm down and trust people more?

"Hello reddit, this community was recommended to me by a friend after speaking with her about the issues I'm having so I'm hoping maybe you can help. 

My mother has lived alone, about 20 minutes from me, for the last fifteen years or so. I make a point to go and visit her at least once a week to spend some time and have tea. This has of course been a little difficult lately given the global circumstances but I'm doing what I can to keep us both safe. 

Some background before I begin:

My mother had a bad home life as a child and often had to mother herself. She got herself through nursing school and married my father at a young age. He was a nasty alcoholic and left her for another woman. She had to completely fend for herself with three young babies and only what money could make at her job as a nurse. She married again much later to a wonderful man. If soulmates exist, he was hers. Unfortunately, due to a heart condition he passed away about thirty years ago and she has been alone since. My sister committed suicide seven years ago and it was a huge blow to all of us. Needless to say, my mother (and our family) has been through a lot.

So here's the problem: She has always been a judgmental person with very high standards for us (myself and two siblings). She never hesitates to make a comment about someone's weight or personal circumstances, often to the point of embarrassing everyone with her. She has a wonderful friend named Marie (fake name of course) who lives next to her in their senior housing community. Marie is very religious and very overweight and comes from a modest background. I think she's a lovely person and she and my mother spend a lot of afternoons together sharing company. My mother is sweet to Marie's face of course, but every time I speak to my mother, without fail she will make some derisive comment about how fat Marie is and how she must have psychological problems to let herself go that much. She constantly remarks that Christians and people with political opinions that don't align with hers are evil. 

She never hesitates to remind me (and her grand kids) how hard she had to work for everything. She speaks poorly of every friend she has, remarks how her son hasn't measured up, and I don't even want to know what she must say about me when I'm not around.  

Now to be fair, she is not an evil person and I don't think she's aware of how nasty she is sometimes. She's incredibly generous, constantly giving gifts even when she can't afford to. She can be really sweet and loving too. It's just that the negativity is 80% of what comes out of her mouth.

I want to spend time with her and be around her. I'm aware that she has been through a lot of hardships in her life and has accomplished a lot for herself. She is certainly lonely so I have sympathy for her of course. I also know that we have limited time with our loved ones in this life and I want to appreciate however many years we have left together. But she is so damn negative and pessimistic I don't know what to do with her. I entertain her hours long phone calls even though they always devolve into what a disaster the political climate is, and how our Earth is doomed due to environmental factors, and how my brother married such a white trash POS, and how the doctors she has never know what they're talking about, etc etc on and on and on. 

I always try to gently turn the conversation to something more positive. When that doesn't work I'll try and shut her down a bit more forcefully (something along the lines of ""I'm not talking about this anymore, mom.""). Most of the time she just steamrolls over me anyway or she gets really huffy and offended. I breaks my heart though. I know she's lonely and she probably can't help that she's so opinionated and miserable. But I'm at the point where I dread spending time with her. 

I see a therapist who tries to help with my boundary setting but it's such slow progress and I'm frustrated. I wanted to see if anyone out there has dealt with something similar and might have some advice. I want to have a relationship with my mother, and I want my kids to want to spend time with her too but we all get the same treatment with her. Five minutes of pleasant conversation and then a heated lecture about how the world is going down the toilet, we're all doomed, and Marie is overweight.

TL;DR my mother is the definition of Negative Nancy and it's making me not want to spend any time with her.",relationships
"Using a throwaway!

Our 6 mo baby girl has just moved into her own room. During the last 6 months, she has slept in a next to me crib in our bedroom. At first husband stayed in our bed but he's always been a noisy sleeper and we found that his noises were keeping me awake once our daughter had finished one of her many overnight feeds leaving me even more sleep deprived than necessary. He moved into the loft and left us to it (this was fine with both of us).

Now that our little one has moved into her own room it's time for the husband to return but we're really struggling for a couple of reasons:

I miss our little girl. Separation anxiety on my part? I know she's only next door and we have the monitor on, I just miss hearing her little piggy snorts at night and waking up to her grinning at me through the mesh. I'm struggling to relax enough at night to sleep, and have been tearful for a few days which I feel is ridiculous but I can't help it.

My husband is a noisy, heavy sleeper. He snores and snorts and groans. He is also some kind of furnace oven. I am a light sleeper. More so now I'm listening out for our daughter.

Does anyone have any useful advice for how my husband and I can sleep harmoniously? I've become used to much more quiet nights, more space and the temperature my body regulates to.

Thanks!

"I understand my boyfriend is having a rough time for a while, he is really stressed and frustrated at everything and everyone, he is even impulsive sometimes, which is really uncharacteristic for him, but I feel like I can't do anything.

We had some fights in the past and I know we hurt each other, but I did my best to improve myself and work it out. But now I feel really empty inside, I don't feel good enough for him. He gets really distant.

I want to help him, sadly professional help is expensive in my country and our parents would make it worse. He tells me that he doesn't known why is he feeling like this and he doesn't want to hurt me. 

But I don't know, I really want to be there for him, but I don't want to feel like this. I don't want to feel like I'm begging him for attention or like he doesn't want to stay with me.

 I understand I have to give him some time, but I'm just really scared I'm gonna lose him.

"    So around 10 years ago, my military family moved from California to Florida, leaving elementary aged me friendless and lost little girl. Somehow among that, I found a ray of sunshine. For privacy reasons, we will call her Lizzy. Lizzy was what I consider to be my very first best friend. From 2nd to about 6th grade we were inseparable. We went to Disney together and to D.C., had endless sleepovers, etc. However, in the 6th grade we had a falling out because my younger sister was being bullied and Lizzy lied about witnessing it. When it came time to confess to administration, she lied and the administration caught her red-handed as they had her on security footage, in the the exact place she said she was not. Therefore, Lizzy got the same punishment as the bullies did an received a two-week out of school suspension at an alternative school. As one might guess, this virtually destroyed our friendship. 
   Later on in the 6th grade, Lizzy created a Facebook page to message me and reconnect. I was thrilled! We talked everyday for months and even got invited to a mutual friend’s sleepover. We went and had a great time and it felt for a moment everything would be okay. However, Lizzy’s mother discovered her Facebook page and our messages and forced Lizzy to block me. Years go by, we go our separate ways, go to different high schools and turn into different people.          This brings us now to present day. Lizzy and I are both 18, graduating high school. Again, we are going our separate ways, as Lizzy is going to a prestigious out of state college and I am opting for a state school. In means of reconnecting, I sent Lizzy a message on Instagram. She never responded. So, as final means of making amends, I reached out to the boyfriend she’s been dating since we had our falling out, Tim. He explained that time healed our differences and that she doesn’t want to dredge up the past. Tim also added that she read my message and purposely chose to ignore it as she has moved on and wants to leave the past in the past. I feel for an issue that 7 years old, it would be easier to address it than to ignore it and feel bad the rest of my life. Tim said he would not be willing to bother her about this issue and that I should find closure in her success and happiness. So, for awhile I was.
   Then came today. I went into Target to buy my mother flowers for Mother’s Day and there Lizzy was, in the flesh. She was working there, collecting carts at the front. I saw what used to be my best friend in the flesh for the first time in nearly 7 years. The second I realized it was her, I ducked hoping she didn’t recognize me and ran off into some random aisle. Luckily, she didn’t. So I left from the furthest exit and sped to my car. I didn’t buy the flowers and I sure as hell didn’t look back. 
   If anything, I’m looking for advice on how to move on. I tried my best to reconnect but clearly, Lizzy is not the forgiving type. I never thought that one day, I’d be ducking to avoid Lizzy, yet here I am. As much as I wish we could rekindle our friendship or be cordial, I have no clue what would allow that. I figured over an issue so small that happened so long ago we would be able to get past it. Clearly, that isn’t happening. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

"&amp;#x200B;

So, for some background:

\- Me (18f) and my ex (22m) had been dating for 7 months, and the last time I saw him was when I went to go and stay with his family before lockdown (UK)

\- We were both in quite bad places when we started dating, and although I managed to get past mine he was still working on his issues

\- We had an argument which led to him realising that he has a lot of stuff he still needs to work through and he feels like he needs to be alone to do this. Before I get comments telling me that this is a BS response, we spoke about it and I know he's being honest, even though it's hard. The night that we broke up we spoke for 5 hours and it was obvious that it was a very difficult decision for him

It's now been 3 weeks since we broke up and we've yet to do an extended period of no contact. We had one call which led to him getting upset. Yesterday, I texted him asking if he'd deleted my nudes (lol) and he ended up asking how I was and sending a meme (?) which was a little odd. From that, I know that he feels like he's doing a lot better in terms of the aforementioned issues, which I was happy to hear.

It's clear that he has stuff to work out, and although it sucks that he feels he needs to do that alone, I understand. However, I'm struggling to not hold out hope that there might be a future for us down the line. He's told me that the only way he thinks this could happen is if we both move on, and that he doesn't want me to hold onto him, he just wants me to be happy. He's not open to having any kind of phone conversation as it went poorly last time and he feels like nothing with where he's at will change, and he doesn't want to jeopardise his mental health. However, we've agreed to meet in September, so I can give him back some of his things and we can talk. While I plan on just focusing on myself and ideally not talking to him, is it stupid to hope that maybe we'll reconnect when we see each other? It's hard to heal with this hope, but I know I wouldn't feel fine with not seeing him at all. We had a good relationship and were very happy together.

TLDR; had a really good relationship with someone, broke up on good terms because he needs to work through some personal issues, seeing him in september, is it stupid to be hopeful that we'll rekindle the flame?",relationships
"Originally posted on relationship advice but didnt get any advice 



I (18m) was bored last night so I decided to set up an account on a dating app I'd installed a few nights ago and i started swiping for a bit when i came across my freinds profile (18m) the 1st picture he had I recognised as being old so I assumed it was an old account he forgot to delete but the second picture is quite recent and is definitely from when they are going out it even has her (18f) in the picture but his account mentions nothing about her or him being in a relationship. 

I am really close friends with the both of them and I dont know what to do, should I tell her what I found? Do I ask him about it? 

One of my biggest fears is if I ask him about It and he has a completely valid explanation like he is just looking for freinds or something and he gets angry at me for accusing him of something.

Any advice on how to handle this would be massively appreciated.

"Howdy everyone- I ( 24f ) have been in a relationship with my bf ( 26m ) for about a year or so now. He's a very sweet, gentle, and affectionate person and at the beginning of the relationship he was very supportive towards me, and vice-versa. 

Recently ( as in the past 2-3 months ) though I've had a weird problem in that he spontaneously started completely ignoring all of my social media posts, stories, selfies, etc. I know that a lot of people will probably be of the mindset that 'it's just social media', but for context we both have an active presence and  following on social media ( he's a musician, and I'm a freelance artist ) so it's a pretty big part, like it or not, of both of our careers and lives. I always go out of my way to support his content, but I also genuinely like his content to be fair; he's my boyfriend, so why wouldn't I like his content and want to see / interact with it?

He seemed to be the same way for the larger part of our relationship, until very recently. This would probably bother me less if he wasn't active on social media at all, but he actively likes and interacts with posts and stories of his close friends and family. It genuinely seems deliberate to me, and I just don't understand it; I update frequently on several platforms that we're friends with each other on and I know that he sees my posts ( he views my stories, and on a few occasions I've tried to coax out a discussion on the subject matter by asking if he saw a particular selfie / post and he'll say something like, 'Yeah, it came across my feed' but drop the subject ). 

I would really like to talk to him about it, but I always feel a little silly bringing it up- I don't want to be controlling or sound like a nagging girlfriend. I think my concern is moreso that it feels to me like it correlates to a lack of interest and support. It's especially disappointing and demoralizing right now, considering that we don't live together, and have not been able to hang out in person as a result of social distancing and the shelter-in-place order. I don't consider myself jealous or clingy, but I can't help but feel a twinge of hurt when I see him strategically like every post from a close female friend who posts similar content, but strategically ignores mine- it hurts my feelings to know that he's capable of showing the support that I want from our relationship to others, but not to me. 

Any kind of advice or perspective on the situation, or how to bring it up in a non-confrontational manner would be hugely appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this. :)

TLDR: My ( 24f ) bf ( 26m ) and I are both content creators online, and for the past 2-3 months he has been viewing my posts but not liking or interacting with them at all. This is making me feel unsupported and I'm looking for advice or perspective on how to have a conversation with bf about this without making it feel like I'm forcing him to support my content.",relationships
"Hi Reddit, so I'm in no speaking terms with my recent ex who I was with for 4.5 years, and he blocked me on everything before I had the chance to do it to him so I need your help right now.

So not even a year ago from now, my then-boyfriend and I bought a phone for him but he couldn't afford to buy even a low-end but pretty decent one on his own so I temporarily paid around 73% (I calculated it) of the phone, roughly Php 8k (160 dollars) and I agreed that he doesn't have to pay me right away, but he could pay me Php 1k (20 dollars) monthly because he can't afford to pay for more. With the ecq happening, he was only able to pay me around 60 dollars before the ecq happened and stopped paying me since then. 

I would really like to have my 100 dollars back now so I could use it to pay for my online counseling but I don't know how to approach him considering he blocked me on everything and I can't get out of the house yet. How do I ask nicely when I just want to curse at him for leaving me?

tl; dr: My ex didn't continue paying me during the ecq but I want my 100 dollars back so I can continue online counseling that I knew I had to go through because he left me after 4.5 years of being together and I need help on how I can ask for the money back

Edit: I'm still in college and 100 dollars can do a lot for me right now so I'm pretty pressed about the money not getting paid back and in my country, we don't really get much chance on summer jobs because I live in a third world country and the unemployment rate is already pretty high and I'm not ready to compete with that w/o a degree so I don't know how I'm getting that money back in another way right now",relationships
"So, I recently broke up with my boyfriend but it was fairly mutual and we are on friendly terms.  Unfortunately, we live in a one bedroom apartment together, have a long way left on the lease, and are still in the middle of quarantine. Ontop of that, I found out some disturbing information from mutual friends about his outward disrespect and disregard towards me during our time of dating, which I hadnt known about and in which he lied about and/or hid from me. My period is also nearly a week late, so that's cool (sarcasm).
   
Anyways, I promised not to discuss it with him to protect said friends. Needless to say, I'm a little bit angry about what I found out and I have lost all trust even though we are broken up. This has made me a lot more insecure and paranoid during our living together despite us being broken up. Im trying to keep my emotions under control and also move on emotionally but I'm having a really hard time doing that and just not caring about things while living together. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to make living with an ex emotionally more manageable? Or how to move on when you have to see them everyday? I feel so incredibly emotionally irrational right now because I cant get my emotions on board with our new situation/being not together. 

Tl;dr- broke up with boyfriend but we live together and I find myself having really irrational emotions towards everything. Normally i go 6 months without speaking to an ex before I can be friends and not be so emotionally hypersensitive/insecure about everything following a breakup.

"Sorry in advance for the long post. 

So my boyfriend and I are both 22 and met during our first year of college (we graduated today!). He is from CA and the way he talks about home you would think CA is God’s gift to the world. I am from MA. I also love where I grew up and New England in general. We go to school in upstate NY. 

The climate at our school is cold and windy most of the time. We get dumped on with lake effect snow which can last into May. The summers are hot and humid, like most of New England. 

My problem is my bf can’t stop shitting on where we live. The cold weather sets him into these depressive moods. He complains about the lack of sun and the snow, especially when it’s out of season. I don’t have a problem with the occasional complaint, it snowed yesterday and I was annoyed as well. My problem is that when he shits on our school he often expands it to all of New England, including where I grew up. He says he doesn’t understand why anyone would chose to settle in a place like this and how CA is so much better because you get to skip the worse seasons. He then gets annoyed when I get defensive over where I grew up. 

I just feel like he doesn’t understand that when he complains about the winter and the weather all the time it feels like he is tearing down an essential part of my upbringing. I love the winter and having changing seasons and it’s a little insulting when he acts like anyone who lives here is crazy. 

Is this something I should just let go and chalk up to him not having childhood experiences like mine? 

TLDR: My BF and i live in a climate I grew up in and he didn’t. He often remarks that he can’t believe anyone would voluntarily live where there is what he describes as “not CA weather”. I find it insulting. Should I just let it go?",relationships
"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year. He's known his girl BFF for a couple of years before he met me (around three yrs) . Right before we dated, they tried to see if their friendship could turn into something more. It didn't work out since she started talking to someone else, and we met shortly after. He had always told me that they're just friends, and never did anything sexual besides make out with each other. I really do trust him to be faithful, so I respected the friendship. When they do hang out, it's almost always just to smoke weed. Although I think it's okay to have female friends, I can't say it doesn't bother me.

Things didn't work out in her relationship, the ex-partner didn't want to be serious. Well yesterday, my boyfriend tells me that she made a comment a couple months ago about ""always letting the good guys go for assholes,"" referring to my boyfriend as the good guy. I don't know what thats supposed to mean, but it feels inappropriate to say. I'm not sure what response she was hoping for. I was upset he didn't mention anything sooner, but I understand why he made that judgement. He just ignored the comment and she never said anything like that again. While discussing it, I told him that I wished he set more boundaries sooner, like not smoking/hanging out with her alone.

This morning, she sent him a text at six am asking if he was awake bc she needed a friend. She proceeds by saying she's just sad and thought they could smoke together. Then she writes, word for word, ""I haven't talked to you in a while, I don’t even talk to anyone else, not even my man."" I tend to read into things too much, but it didn't seem right that she couldn't talk to her own boyfriend. When I told him that, he said, ""she should have other people like me to talk to, but she doesn’t, so I can’t just say no to my friend when she needs someone to talk to."" She doesn't want to text or call to talk about it. So pretty much, he's going to go smoke with her, alone, to talk about why she's sad.

I'm upset that he's making an exception on the boundaries, but I don't know if I'm being crazy because I don't like her. I don't want to, but should I just suck it up and accept them hanging out alone as friends?

"Apologies for formatting etc as I'm on mobile. This is a bit of a long post as there's quite a lot of backstory so bear with!

My boyfriend and I have been officially together for a bit over 1.5 years and were seeing each other casually for a few months before that. We've been living together for about 9 months. We have a few mutual friends so ended up going on a group holiday together in the summer of 18. At the time of the holiday, he had a girlfriend. In fact, I had gone out in group settings with the two of them as a couple shortly before the holiday, we mutually followed each other on socials etc. She wasn't exactly a friend, but she was an acquaintance and all three of us went to the same school. 

Well my now bf and I got on really well during the holiday we spent together and went from not really knowing each other too well to being good friends. I found out a few weeks after we got back that he'd actually broken up with his gf. Maybe a month after we got back from our holiday, he asked me out for a drink. I declined a few times as I thought it was moving a bit fast for him, but the following month we went on our first date. 

I originally felt like a rebound, but I didn't mind at first as it was very casual. He later told me that the reason for his break up was that he'd fallen out of love with his ex and that they probably should have broken up 6 months before they actually did. He has even said that, as much as he knew it was wrong and didn't act on it at the time, he knew from when we were on holiday that he wanted to be with me. When we first starting dating, I felt very aware of the ex. He was logged into all her accounts on streaming sites, air BnB, she had a user on his PS4 etc. I had previously told my bf in the early stages of us dating that I'm better off not knowing about her and he stuck to this. After we got a lot more serious, I found out from a friend that they lived together for 6 months at his parents' house which I did not know about at all. I felt so shocked and betrayed by this, even though I know I have no right to.

I'm not sure what gets me upset the most. Maybe it's the proximity of their relationship to ours, or the fact that I thought he wasn't over her when we first started dating. I get jealous when I think about all the weddings they went to together, especially both of his siblings. I hate seeing photos of her at these weddings at his grandparents' and parents' houses. I hate that his family still like and comment on all of her stuff on socials and I feel insecure that they prefer her to me. 

I know I should stop checking her socials and I have tried really hard in the past, often going months without doing so, but for the last few weeks, I've been checking them every day. This is probably worsened by the fact that a lot of my friends follow her and sometimes send me things she's posted (well meaning, thinking I should know). A week or so ago, she quote tweeted a tweet about the stigmatisation of buying pregnancy tests, saying that her and her ex (my boyfriend) had bought a pregnancy test and condoms and were treated badly by the staff at the time. She has tweeted a lot about him in the past. I was following her for a while, but got tired of seeing these tweets, so eventually unfollowed. Since seeing the most recent tweet, I have blocked her on socials, but still find it hard to resist taking a peak regularly. 

This is affecting my relationship with my boyfriend. I often feel upset if I see something on her socials and he can tell, which leads to us talking about it. He deals with my insecurities pretty well generally, but can get defensive if he feels like I'm criticising him for having a past. He tells me that he's never felt this way about anyone before and that he doesn't think of her except in the context of me getting upset about her/them. It's probably important to note that while I have dated people casually before, he is my first long term relationship.

How do I resist the urge to stop looking at her socials? I thought that having dated this long, I would be over this. Has anyone been in a similar situation and found a way to stop thinking about their partner's ex? All advice gratefully received.

Tldr: dated bf for 1.5 yrs but still look at his ex gf's socials and find it hard to get over her. How do I move on from this?",relationships
"I [18F] am really close with my brother [15M] who has mild to moderate autism. I look after him throughout the day and usually he's pretty calm and watches TV with me. Today in the afternoon, my mother was sleeping as she looks after him from 5am till the afternoon as he doesn't sleep much (we've tried medicine, but it makes him lethargic the whole day so we don't use it) and we were watching TV like usual. 

My grandfather was reading and it got pretty dark in the room so he wanted to turn the lights on but my little brother doesn't like that for some reason and he tried to turn them off. I tried to explain to my brother that we need the lights on so that we can see and my grandfather was getting irritated (he lost his hearing so he didn't really get was going on either) and so my little brother didn't like that I turned the lights back on and started pulling my hair. It's not the first time he's done that and my parents always make him apologise after but he still does it. He doenst really get the concept of saying sorry, he knows to say it when someone's upset at him when he's told to but he'll still do it again.

So he was pulling my hair and I tried pulling away but he wounldt let go so out of defence I hit him (not too hard) so he'd let go, I regretted it immediately becuase I love my brother very much and he means the world to me, I never ever hit him but this time all the anger from all the times he pulls my hair just accumulated and it was too late. I know it was a butt hole thing for me to do and I'm never doing to do it again.

So what should we do? How can I get him to not hit me and pull my hair when he's mad and defend myself. He bites through stress balls so those are no good.

"There is quite a bit of backstory here, I'll try to get through it quickly but let me know if anything is unclear and I'll do my best to clear it up. 

About 5ish years ago I moved into an apartment with my now Ex who I will call Lily. About a year or so after moving in things weren't working out romantically between us and we split amicably. The apartment is really nice and ideal for the both of us so Lily and I decided to keep living together in spite of the break up. I moved into the spare bedroom and we have been co-inhabiting platonically ever since. 

I've spent the last few years casually dating and my current boyfriend who I'll call Andy is my first serious relationship since Lily. I started dating him about 8 months ago and a few weeks ago in the interest of full discloser I told him Lily and I used to date but he has nothing to fear we've been split for years now and I have romantic feelings for her anymore. At first he took it well but ever since its clearly been bothering him. He's asked me multiple times why I choose to live with an ex and even after explaining it to him (the apartment is nice and comfortable, its close to work and some shops, moving is a hassle I'd rather not deal with, etc) its weird, he always accepts the answer at the time but a few days later he'll ask again. 

He asked again last Friday and by now I've started getting really annoyed with the question so I asked to just be honest with his feelings and not beat around the bush. He finally confessed his discomfort about me living with Lily and ask that I move out. That's a flat no and I told him as such. Beyond me just not wanting to move I actually own not rent, so for me moving isn't as simple as breaking lease and packing up, I'd have to go through the hassle of selling and buying a new place. Andy then proposed that I kick Lily out and let him move in. I'm really hesitant to do that, first of all Lily is one of my oldest friends and I don't want to do that to her. Second, I don't think Andy and I are at the 'move in together' stage of the relationship. I'm hesitant to take that step with someone I've been dating less than a year. 

Andy accused me of taking Lily's side over his and got mad at my refusal to accommodate him. But it seems to me that all his requests have been really unreasonable or unrealistic. I don't even know how to accommodate him without uprooting mine or Lily's life and I don't think Andy is being fair to either of us. He ended up leaving in a huff after this argument and later I got a text from him saying to either make the decision to kick Lily out or he'll break up with me.

I talked with Lily as soon as I got that text and she was upset by it. She told me to simply do what I want and she'll understand my choice, which honestly made me feel worse. I really don't want to hurt Lily in any way, she's a sweetheart and Andy's behavior has made me tempted to break up with him myself. I do want to see other people's opinions though before I make a decision. Is there any validity to Andy's concern? Am I the unreasonable one for refusing to budge, or is he for making the demand in the first place?

TL;DR Boyfriend is uncomfortable with me living with an ex, wants me to kick her out. I don't want to and we are at an impasse.",relationships
"How to be single - hints, tips and advice needed

I’ve been in relationships since I was 17 (now 35). 

Married twice, I have been both divorced and widowed. Since then I had a relationship for 18 months that I ended and as of today I ended a relationship that lasted 6 months. 

I know deep down I need to be single for a while. I thought I tried really hard last time to not get into a relationship but clearly I didn’t listen to myself and here I am. Coming out of another relationship. 

I don’t know why I feel the need to be in a relationship?? I know I don’t like being alone, but surely I am able to control myself enough to not get into a relationship when I know deep down I don’t want one? 

Side note, I joke that I’m a sex addict. I might have to explore that to see if I do genuinely need some kind of counselling/help with that. 

TL:DR

So people of the internet. How do I, a bright, bubbly, friendly, possibly addicted to sex, fun loving lady, learn to be OK without a relationship??",relationships
"
We’ve been in a relationship for almost a year, and have recently moved in together. Me (26f) he (29m). Relationship is going good and we’re planning for a future together.

He used an old phone of mine while his was broken. When I took it back I saw he hadn’t logged out from his Instagram, and I unfortunately couldn’t resist the urge to look at it. I know that wasn’t right of me, and I should just have logged out and respected his integrity. But I didn’t have that restraint. 

I saw his search history. And he had searched for these regular and cute girls, not some hot models/celebrities/influencers showing of their bodies (which honestly would have bothered me less)
Just normal girls with few followers. 

I’m aware of the fact that I have some insecurity issues, from past relationships/ and self esteem related. I’m working on it. So a part of me just wants to brush it off. I don’t want to be the girlfriend that cares about stuff like this honestly. My anxiety is just overwhelming sometimes. 

But it’s still this nagging feeling I can’t shake. Like where does he find them, and why does he search them. Some of them are from the same town.

I know it’s not friends/coworkers/classmates/exes. Since he doesn’t have that much of a social life except for me and one close friend. 

He also hasn’t written to anyone or liked anything. 
But then he has less then 10 followers and following like 20 people, so maybe he thinks I would question it if he started following a bunch of random girls.


I know I should just let it go, but for some reason I can’t. 
what contributes more to this feeling is the fact that he’s also generally very private with his phone, and constantly on it. 

He takes it to the bathroom with him all the time, and sleeps with it during the night. 
I just brushed it off because I know some people are addicted to their phones and can’t focus without it/and he has it in bed to listen to stuff while falling asleep. 

Should I just stop overthinking it? 

Social media can be such a plague in relationships.

TL;DR: boyfriends search history on Instagram is a bunch of random and regular girls from out city. Not friends/coworkers/classmates/exes.",relationships
"My friend, May, has been struggling with her extremely controlling parents since she starting being able to think for herself. Her mother is the cause of the bulk of her issues, being the instigator of most punishments. She is a teacher at May's school and has taken advantage of it by monitoring what she does on her lunch break and her spare. Before people go on saying to report her, the school is an extremely small, borderline private french school and all of the teachers, including the principal, are friends. To fully understand the extent of their control, I'll list a few examples: May was not allowed to sleep over at a friends house until she was 16. She isn't allowed to have any form of electronic on the second floor of their house, even on the weekends. She isn't allowed to buy her own clothes, as her mom thinks anything she choses looks, her words, ""slutty"". 

Now you're probably thinking ""Oh she must be wearing crop tops, going out with boys and doing drugs for her parents to be that controlling!"" Well, if you've ever seen r/insaneparents, that would sum up her parents, and she would be definition of a goody two-shoes. Her mother is a non-practicing french catholic, but still holds their values. 

Now, on to the most recent situation...

May applied for 4 different universities this fall, she wants to major in English and become a teacher. There are programs here called ""concurrent ed"" that combine your chosen major, as well as teachers college, which cuts down the total years in school by three semesters. Her parents make too much money for her to be eligible for financial assistance, so her parents have agreed to pay for part of her education. That being said, her parents told her that they can only afford to send her to the local university, which does not offer her program, only an English major. May was understandably devastated.  

On top of his, recently May has been experiencing minor spasms associated with her epilepsy, which the doctors thought she had grown out of as she hadn't had symptoms in over 8 years. Her drivers license, which she only got a few months ago because her parents didn't think she was ready, was revoked due to her epilepsy. Since then, her parents have been treating her like an incapable child, saying ""How would you expect to function in another city? What if you had a seizure? It's better to be around family."" Her parents have been slowly manipulating her into thinking that she wouldn't be able to function without them, and it breaks my heart. 

She desperately wants to get away and calls me every once and tell me that she doesn't want to be the kid that never moves out of her parents house. I've given her some suggestions that could help her get away and be stable financially, but she isn't very strong-willed or confident that it'll work out. I want her to reach her fully potential and not be held back by her parents, but I don't know how I can support her and help make a difference. I dont think there's anything more I can do to help, but I want to support her no matter the decision she makes.

TL;DR: My friend is being manipulated by her parents and I don't know how to support her through what she's going through.",relationships
"My close friend has been dating his girlfriend for almost 7 months now. She honestly triggers a lot of red flags for me (no social media, keeping him away from our friend group often, etc.), but I never really said anything because I knew he wouldn't listen. Things came to a head recently though.

It's usually a tradition that after mother's day, our friend group will go out and have breakfast together. Due to recent events though, not many restaurants are open and those that are, are operating at limited capacity. Things are starting to get better here though and we all haven't been together in over a month. So we decided to plan a brunch at my apartment, that way things are safer and we can all keep our distance.

My close friend said he was good to come, but then suddenly texted me that he wouldn't be able to make it. I found this strange and to be honest, he hasn't been around anyone but his girlfriend and family since this whole quarantine thing started. My alarm bells went off and I called him and confronted him on why he couldn't come. He explained to me that since he is currently quarantining at his girlfriend's house, he didn't want to risk getting her sick and also mentioned that she hadn't been invited.

To be clear, none of us have really been in contact with anyone except each other and our families. His girlfriend wasn't invited, but no one's significant other that isn't part of the friend group was invited either. I told him that I didn't believe this was his idea and that I thought his girlfriend was the one that told him to stay home. He seemed agitated at that and said that even if it wasn't his idea, he felt it was the right course of action since it's her house and he wanted to ""respect her health and boundaries"".

I let it go of course because I knew I wouldn't get anywhere with it, but this seriously concerns me. His girlfriend is actually controlling his every move. Every time he cancels on us, I see him posting something on Snapchat or Instagram of them together. I don't want to go full confrontation on this because I know it's shocking, but I really believe that she is trying to isolate him from us. Every excuse he gives sounds like it came straight from her mouth. He talks about boundaries and respect and other words that he doesn't use EVER unless it's relating to her. I'm very worried for him at this point, but I'm not sure how to sit him down and talk to him about this. Any advice is appreciated.

tl;dr: Close friend cancels on plans last minute because of girlfriend. This is a recurring problem since they started dating. Is using talking points that sound like they came straight from her mouth.",relationships
"Is she seeing someone else?

Long story short, my girlfriend of a year (22F) and I (21M) broke up a few months ago because we were fighting really badly and having trouble figuring out how to resolve the issue. She said that she wanted to be alone to grow and find herself, and that she wanted the same for me. She told me multiple times she loved me and hoped that things could be different for us one day, but that for right now she just wanted to be alone. I obliged. There was this new coworker (19M) who started working with her a couple months before we broke up and they follow each other on Instagram. She never liked any of his pictures before we broke up, but now she likes every single one of them. Am I paranoid or could something else be going on here?

"I discovered that my girlfriend of 6 months has been saying some really hurtful things about me to a friend behind my back. One thing she said was that I disgust her, body and face. When I confronted her about it, she blamed the time of the month, not kidding. Then she tried to explain by saying that the particular friend is not fond of me and that she (my gf) is just trying to tell her friend what she wants to hear, and that she doesn’t really feel that way. Our relationship has been mostly great, aside from the occasional disagreement, but this of course is having me look at things in a new light. Is there any hope in this? Should I give her the benefit of the doubt?

"**TLDR: My “outer” libido is practically dead, my inner mind is wandering around sexual thoughts everyday**

I (27M) live with my girlfriend (25F) of 1 year and looking for advice concerning a very interesting and weird situation with my libido, which has been progressing for the past 3 to 4 months.

I used to characterize myself as a high libido person: always eager to get sexual, explore new stuff and so on. Sex was never a problem with any of the past relationships I had. The issue appeared roughly in February and has been mounting since - it’s very difficult to explain that in words, but the closest I can describe it is I get into some kind of stupor once she tries to initiate sex OR act flirty and naughty without any innuendos. At the same time, the number of times I initiated sex since that can be count on one hand. Which is weird, because I still want sex and I crave it on the inside, I realize I now definitely have a barrier expressing myself sexually and getting freaky, or simply my brain is too damn controlling to let go and get in the sexual mood.

Seriously, I don’t know how to describe it better and I have nothing to add on top of that, but it’s eating me on the inside and I get depressed because of this.

A typical flow looks as follows:
1. She gets sexy and stuff, tries to initiate sex 
2. I go into the stupor mode and refuse her unconsciously (because yes - I still want to have sex with her!)
3. I end up frustrated because I don’t have sex. WTF?!

Ever before that, sex was literally 10/10. Best sex we had since then was on weed - this is the only and ultimate way for me to relax, let go and fully enjoy the moment. Otherwise it seems that I don’t fully enjoy the act, even when it occurs.

Little background about myself: I am fit and healthy, go to gym 4 times a week and overall in a very good shape. I run my own business, which is definitely stressful and energy-consuming, but then again I’m kinda used to it. The problem is definitely with me and I want to work on it, but can’t seem to find a cause of the issue, which is why I’m here.

Of course she also noticed this and she’s definitely not too happy about it, as she has a high libido too. We talked about it and agreed it’s fine, as long as I recognize the problem and work on it.

**FAQ**:
1. My hormone levels are all good. I use several supplements approved by my fitness coach (protein/creatine/vitamin complex), so the T level and other hormones were out of the question, but I still got checked a few times and it’s more than fine, so it’s solely a mental issue, rather than a physical one.
2. On the other hand, I’ve had all the symptoms of low T over the past few months: low energy, low libido, mild depression and apathy, inability to focus or get things done, no motivation to do stuff I used to enjoy, so to put it simply: I feel less like a man than I used to be. At the same time, both testosterone and other hormone levels are exceptionally fine. My erection is great too.
3. My girlfriend gained a bit of weight during the last month, which I definitely don’t like and she’s already working on it, however this doesn’t sound to me like a root of the issue, given my libido (or mental state) went downhill long before that.
4. We have been definitely having issues relationship-wise: several arguments and claims to each other, albeit it was talked through several times and we both came to a mutually acceptable conclusion, which I personally don’t have any problems with. 
5. I don’t have porn issues or addiction too. 

What I’ve tried so far:
1. I’ve been in therapy for more than a year - it definitely helps with other aspects of my life, but everything around sex, my sexual identification and other sex-related issues were never an issue. We talked about it with the therapist, yet we can’t seem to find a reason or cause to everything what’s been happening lately.
2. Meditation is my daily routine and it helped me with 99% of the mental issues (except for this one), this is the primary practice we use during therapy and I use it alone as well. It uncovered a lot of hidden things about my personality before, but not this time.


Dear fellow subredditors, I am looking for any thoughts or advice on this situation. I would be more than happy to talk to anyone who had a similar issue before. All in all, open for any thoughts, any actionable steps and “try X” would be highly appreciated. Thank you!

"And you know what? I get it. They have a lot more in common. I don't play video games, I don't watch their robot TV shows. Time with me can be pretty dull. Folding clothes or tidying up, going back and forth about what to watch on Netflix till we decide to watch nothing at all, not really listening to the other's conversations half the time (only so long I can hear about sad current events and only so long he can hear about what so and so said on facebook). I don't really know what happened. Maybe it's quarantine. We've been together 7 years and just seem to be bickering more often lately. Right now he's playing games with them. I don't want to get mad at him for having friends, it's a good thing. If I ask to spend time with him he'll agree if he doesn't have other plans, but then we just end up sitting around and making small talk. I don't know what's going on but I'd like to fix it.

"Together 1 year and 2 months. Engaged and living together.
Since lockdown began I’ve put on a bit of weight that I’d lost, which I’ve told her has effected my self esteem and I don’t feel as attractive or confident. I work at home for an IT manufacturer, she goes to work as normal. I’ll spend most of my day working then cleaning and making dinner, make lunch for the next day for her and get up and make breakfast before she goes to work. 
Our sex life has taken a dip recently. What used to be nightly before we moved in has become less frequent which I don’t see as a massive issue because when she gets home we eat dinner then she falls asleep on the sofa.

Today I missed a signal and she went off, talking about how I half ass the relationship and we have sex very rarely now and when we do it’s shit because she feels it’s forced. That I’m too busy masturbating all day(I don’t at all) so don’t desire her anymore. She claims I don’t ever want to do anything but when I do suggest something it’s usually rebuffed or she wants to do something different.
We don’t discuss our wedding plans because she doesn’t like planning so wants me to do that and she’ll okay things she agrees with, doesn’t wear her ring now because she forgets to and said “what’s there to look forward to, being engaged and living together doesn’t mean anything, it doesn’t mean you love someone” during our argument. If i cry, she says I’m doing it so she stops shouting at me as if I can’t just be upset, she said she’s bored of me and fed up, she feels like she’s hit a new low because she practically has to beg me for sex when she could easily go out and get it any time she wants but she wants it from me. 

This did lead to some fairly intense sex which I realise is not a constructive way to handle the things said but after she said she didn’t mean them. 

What I want to know is should I approach the idea of us ending things if this is going to continue where we spiral down then come back up? What way should I approach this?

"Complicated backstory that I'll condense. We've been together for 6 years, and had lived together for 3 years (with our kids...he has 2 and I have 1). One year ago I found out that he had cheated on me (a year prior). He was accidentally outed and he initially denied it. I was so upset that I left right way and stayed with my dad. Over the next few months I found a small apartment to rent.

&amp;#x200B;

But I found it hard to stay away from him. He was very contrite and the kids missed each other so we started seeing each other again daily. We took a vacation last summer, spent holidays together (but never overnight).

&amp;#x200B;

During the pandemic I agreed to stay here (a lot of my stuff was actually still here).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel awful, but being here (back how things were) is not good for my mental health. We've fallen back into our old normal family life. But all that does is increase my shock that he cheated on me (not a one night stand either) while we were living together like this. It brings it all back and I keep reliving moments that we spent back then while he was secretly seeing someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to leave and go back to my apartment now. But he (and his 2 children) deeply depend on me, especially right now in the pandemic. I do all the cooking for the family (none of them seem to have a clue how to do more than make toast). We used to use a laundry service but I do the laundry now (again, not sure if any of them even know how to operate a laundry machine). I look after the pets. During the pandemic his elderly mother is also staying here and I look after her (cooking for her, doing her laundry, spending time with her). My partner had a knee replacement earlier this year and is still limping a lot so finds a lot of things difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not as simple as hiring a housekeeper. He was laid off from his job and so money is tight (and in the age of social distancing that isn't going to happen anyway). He also won't understand if I just up and leave because he feels that what happened was in the (distant) past and we are moving forward with our new/improved relationship. But every day I keep remembering what happened, and how he lied to me about where he was and actually had sex with someone else multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

So how can I leave? If I tell him I want to leave it will be a big dramatic thing. Am I terrible for leaving and just leaving him, his kids and his mom in chaos? I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I want to leave my partner (who depends on me) over an affair that I'm supposed to be over.",relationships
"My gf and I have been in a relationship for 5 months and it's gone really perfect so far. But recently she's told me she doesn't feel like having sex until presumably marriage (not for religious reasons) and I completely respect her decision. At first I thought I wasn't sexually attractive but she told me that's not it. She's told me she use to do it pretty often with her ex's but faked it sometimes because she doesn't really like it. She say's she's not asexual but she just doesn't like sex in general because she prefers a relationship based more around someone just caring for her and being there for her.

I really don't know if I can be happy in a relationship with no sex as I'm not asexual but at the same time I really love her to pieces and I know she really loves me too which is why she even opened up about this instead of just faking it. Everything else about her is perfect and she really makes me happy and I don't really know what to do after hearing this 5 months in.

"Hi everyone. Hope you are doing well and are safe.
I am 24M and my gf is 24F. We have been together for about a year. We have a happy relationship i think, though we have a large share of fights as well which leave me numb and drained due to the excessive blowing up response of her which includes blocking and trying to breakup. However recently after a big blowup, i explained to her what her behaviour during fights was doing to me and after a lot of explaining she understood it for the first time and won't do again i hope. But my question is related to somewhat different. During the relationship, i have always had her on my mind and tried to do things for her as much as i could. Frequent fights exhausted me, in which mostly i was put to blame and i kept trying to keep it together and do as much as i could with my leftover energy. In all this, all of me was focused on her, how i should love her to make her happy, how she wants to be loved to be happy, what she expects me to be doing for her.....kind of things. I never thought about myself and what made me feel loved. I don't know what makes me happy. She does what she thinks will make me happy and tries to do her best. I really appreciate that. Though it can make me happy somewhat, it does not give me satisfaction inside of me and I don't know what will. I am not able to figure it out. Now that she has understood the problem with her handling of fights, things are all good between us. But now i am able to think about myself as well along with thinking about her. But i feel empty. I try to express my love for her but i am unable to know for myself what love is and what does it actually feel like for me. I want to be with her, i want to make her happy and that makes me happy somewhat. But peace does not come. At times it feels as if i am not made to be in a relationship with anyone, because I don't know what will make me happy inside. Also she expresses her love to me and i know that but somehow it doesn't coincide with me. She says I don't appreciate her love for me and that hurts her. But i don't know what love is to me and through actions i feel that. I am not sure what is happening and how to handle this. I need some help with this and would be thankful to all.

"He (33M) says our breakup is my (32F) fault.

We dated for two years total, but after about a year we broke up because our friend groups didn't get on. It didn't bother me but he wanted us all to be one big group of friends rather than have my/his friends situation.

We got back together 2 months later. When we got back together I asked if he'd been with anyone else just so I knew where we stood. He told me he hadn't even been able to look at other women while we were broken up because he was so upset.

For a few weeks after we got back together he was acting weird and it didn't feel right, so I asked again if there had been anyone else. He told me more than once that there had been nobody else. This went on and after a month of this I told him something wasn't right and he just had to come out with the truth.

He finally admitted he had slept with another woman the day after we broke up. The fact that he slept with someone so soon after the breakup hurt, but the fact that he lied to me for so long really broke me. He had INSISTED nothing had happened even though he knew I could tell something was up. I felt like I had been gaslighted.

He said he slept with her because he felt insecure after our breakup and that he lied because he was scared of losing me.

Despite common sense saying I should have just ended things there, we got back together. I suggested couples therapy but he said no. We moved in together but I always had this view that I could never fully trust what he told me because he had lied to me for so long and so easily.

The relationship was stable for a while, despite everything but if I brought up what happened or wanted to talk it through he would just cry and tell me he didn’t know what to say or how to make things right. I stopped bringing it up but in the end because it didn’t help, but it ate away at me and we started getting into silly fights.

He broke up with me 6 months ago because he said he'd had enough of my insecurity and lack of trust in him. He said he was sick of fighting and just wanted to start fresh with someone new. He's now got a gf and I'm dating someone else and am happy enough. But I still have this anger over the whole thing because my ex is insisting to everyone that I'm a 'psycho ex' who drove him away with my 'massive insecurity and trust issues'.

I pointed out to him that I wouldn't have had trust issues if he hadn't lied but he says he 'made some mistakes' and that it was my responsibility to get over it to make the relationship work or I should have spoken up more about my feelings. I told him any time I ‘spoke up’ he’d just derail me by crying and offer nothing to help work it out.

He says my failure to deal with it all properly drove him to break up with me.

Was it my fault for not moving past my insecurities once we got back together? Should I have let the past die and just moved forward? Is it my fault that we didn't talk about what happened properly?

tl;dr My ex broke up with me for being insecure for a year after he lied about sleeping with someone else.",relationships

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. We’re both at our childhood home since school went online and the subsequent end of the semester. My friend from high school, AJ(20F) disclosed to me that her and JT have been ""talking"" and even kissed a couple of times.

JT warned me that his friends were raunchy or whatever and that’s why he didn’t want me to date him but he neglected to see that he’s the same way. He’s one of those pretty boy playa types. He goes through girls like water. I don’t think that my brother is downright disrespecting girls or leading them on but once he gets bored then he’s done. I’ve had so many girls hate me in high school because of him. I’m so glad we go to separate colleges.

My issue is AJ has had a crush on that ugly brother of mine for a couple years now. I’m worried she might get hurt here. I don’t know if I should tell her to play it cool because we know how he treats girls once he’s bored. I don’t know if I should talk to JT and tell him not to get really involved with this girl unless he’s serious. 

This isn’t a casual relationship. AJ told me she wants a real relationship with this boy.

Advice please!!!!

"Hi and good morning everyone. I’m here in hopes that a different pair of eyes can potentially see what I’m actually annoyed about or maybe I’m just that crazy. 

I’ve been in a LDR with my bf for 6 months now and this weekend has really just brought out an annoyance that I’ve just silently felt. I’m not too big on showing or feeling loudly. But first some context: my bf is great. We do have differences and some mild to moderate fights. Nothing we can’t ever overcome. To summarize it there’s a lot of double standards. This weekend would be one of those double standards. On Friday he gave me the bare minimum of information that he’d go help a friend move some stuff to a cabin. That’s it. I was like okay. We can talk the next day. Do yo thang and I’ll do my thang kind of thing. Usually posts on social media if he’s smoking or drinking and the friend. But this time nothing. I confronted him about why he didn’t and he said “there was nothing to post” and I made a mental note of that because he in the past has given me so much shit about social media posting and will make me feel like I’m hiding something if I don’t post something when I say I’m doing x y or z. 

Turns out he spent the night wherever he was with a friend I don’t know because he smoked and drank too much. Overall I think I’m upset of the lack of communication and idk how to tell him how suspicious he comes on when maybe he’s not doing anything. He often makes me out to be like a terrible gf out doing unimaginable things with other people or “men” (there aren’t any). And idk I’m just tired and frustrated of the double standards. But I also may be thinking too much about it. What do ya think? 

Thanks reddit for hearing me out.

TL;DR - I’m tired of the double standards in my relationship and this weekend really is annoying me with my LDR bf being vague about details when he’d make a big deal if I did the same.",relationships
"We've been friends for years and apart from his girlfriend (open relationship) he doesn't really have close friends but I find his behaviour towards me extremely inappropriate and despite me asking him to stop he won't and just says that it's hard to change. 

Here's a little list of things he does: ""rate"" me despite not having been asked, telling me pretty much every time when he and his girlfriend have sex or when he masturbates (also unwarranted), generally bringing up sex and porn all the time and asking invasive questions, repeatedly asking me if I wanted a three some with him and his girlfriend when I was taking care of my terminally ill mother (despite me pointing out that even if I did asking *now* is just disgusting), making fun of my mental health and grief (but always saying he doesn't  mean it like that) and monitoring and calling me out on my social media/whatsapp activity whenever I don't reply as fast as he'd like me to. 

I've told him quite in detail what I think about these behaviours, he said he'll try to stop but change is hard (he's just not empathetic enough to see how calling someone who has struggled with mental health issues and recently lost someone might not be to happy about being called insane or broken) and especially with the unwarranted sexual conversations and the media surveillance he doesn't see anything wrong about it and says it's normal. 

My questions: is this normal? Am I overreacting? I have a bunch of other friends and our conversations tend to be way different from what he's pulling off but maybe the entire rest of my social circle is just as ""insane"" as I am. And if it isn't can why of you explain why he might do that because I don't get it. 

He said he wants to change but that he doesn't know if and how he can do that and that this is just how he is (however we had a less severe version of this talk 6 months ago and I feel like it's gotten worse so I don't buy it) . I told him that I need space and think about if I want to continue this friendship. Quite frankly I don't want to, I told him about things that make me very vulnerable and he repeatedly used this information to make me the butt of the joke...also I don't want the forced sex talk all the time. 

Tldr: friend is regularly making uncomfortable/inappropriate comments, apparently ""can't"" change and I just don't want to be on the other side of this anymore. Am I right to cut him off or am I overreacting?",relationships
"We have been together for 1.5 years. We live together since 6 months, now we are in different cities due to the lockdown.

2 years before the start of our relationship we had a short relationship but we broke up because he wasn't ready for a commitment. After that we were friends but I have always had crush on him. During this time I developed a lot of insecurities and trust issues and I became jealous of one of his girl friends. This girl is his best friend's sister and even though we're together and he has told me several times that he has no feelings for her, I'm still getting jealous every time they meet around his best friend. 

I realise that I shouldn't be jealous and I've never had such issues in previous relationships. We've talked about it and he told me that he will help me overcome my insecurities. Last night he met with his best friends and this girl of course and I felt very bad because I expected him at least to send me a text when he gets home or to do something else knowing about all those things. We talked about it this morning, he said he's sorry and that I'm getting obsessed with him and I think he's right.

I don't want to feel all those feelings but it's just a thing I can't control. I've never felt this way in a relationship and I just want to be myself again.
Could someone give me advice what I need to do and how to overcome my insecurities? I don't want to ruin the relationship.

TL;DR! Being jealous of my boyfriend is getting me obsessed with him and I want to avoid intoxication of our relationship. I would like some advice to overcome the insecurities.",relationships
"It's a long story but the gist of it is. I became jealous at the time she was spending with newer friends. (Yes I know I'm wrong for doing so. Even before the blocking, I was already feeling horrible about it) I got upset about her avoiding me a lot. But she never told me why she was avoiding me. We were best friends for years. Talking everyday, phones calls, present exchanging and playing games. I was already upset about things in my life. Well we had a big scuffle about it. And I said things about her that have been bugging me. (zoning out when I talked about things, always calling me but I can never call her when I want to talk and play games when she wants to play) She kept avoiding me and made another account in order to avoid me more on Xbox. I found out and confronted her about it. She lied about it until a week later she told me it was her account. Reason why I went off on her. 

Took a break like she said. But I wanted to squash things. So after a month I wanted to talk to her about things, I said ""call me, I want to talk about things"". She gave me a nasty attitude saying I was demanding. I was pissed cause I just wanted to talk things out, I didn't want to be friends with her again after a while and we are still having problems because we didn't talk them out. So I was just pissed, had a mental break (I lost my job and stayed at home for far too long. Caused it all) told her off again. And that was it I guess. 

She blocked later that week. I know I did a lot of things wrong. I was crazy, lost my mind, I was extremely depressed and anxious. Losing my job hurt. I didn't want to lose her too. Blocked me on everything and that's all she wrote. Didn't respond, didn't say anything. 2+ years of friendship and we couldn't recover from all this. 

What I want is advice on how to move on. I still think about her, I care for her, wishing she would talk to me again. However I know this won't happen again. I'm trying to move forward but it's difficult. She was a big part of my day to day. Her missing from my life has left a soreness. Don't know where to go from here. She was my **Best** friend, one and only. And now she is just gone. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you for reading.

Tl;dr I messed a lot of things up in the friendship by being jealous of newer friends in her life, the time she spent with them and the distance she gave me. Got mad a few times trying to talk it out. Got blocked. Need advice to get over it.",relationships
"We  met a couple of times (sex happened) and I ghosted her due to 1.  finding her unattractive 2. not interesting 3. kind of vapid. She sends  me memes and says hello on facebook sometimes- maybe once a month- and I  never answer. It's been about 4 months. I have no intention of  answering any of her messages.

A  few days ago I received a letter where she is telling me how hurt she's  been about what happened and how much she liked me back then and how she  wishes we could talk. Apparently, she had/has (?) a crush on me. I have  no idea what to do with this letter. It's written on nice paper and  arrived in a fancy envelope. She has obviously put a lot of time into  this. She finishes the letter by saying that she doesn't expect me to  reply and she just needed to let me know how she felt.

I hate to say it but I really feel nothing for her and don't care about her at all. What should I do?

"So we've only been together officially for only 1 month, but dated for 6. Since becoming official though we haven't been able to see each other because of the lockdown.

Ever since I've known her she'll only reply to my texts around 3-4 time a day, sometimes only twice a day. This never really bothered me all that much, but now that we're together her habit hasn't changed at all and it's starting to bug me. I've asked her about it and she says she just doesn't check her messages that often, and I do believe her, she literally wont be online hours at a time before replying to me. But I just find it a bit ridiculous that she wont bother to look at her phone for a reply to a conversation we're clearly having.

Idk, the lockdown is stressing me out not being able to see her, and it's hard for me to not be affected by her not replying for several hours at a time. Makes me feel sort of ignored. I feel silly for it but it genuinely puts my mood down. What should I do about this?

"I currently rent a house with my college roommate. We have been best friends throughout almost all of college. Because of everything going on, we’ve been together pretty much 24/7 since early March. We’ve lived together every year in college except my junior year (I went abroad), and she’s become such a negative person since I came back. 

She has turned into one of the most self-absorbed people I have ever met, and it makes me so frustrated. I struggled a lot with becoming a better person in college and while I’m definitely still a work in progress, I’m leaps and bounds from where I was when I started. She seems to have regressed, and while everyone’s mental health is obviously different, she has no desire to want to get better and needs constant attention from me, which I don’t have the desire to give all the time. 

All we ever talk about is this boy she’s in love with who lives thousands of miles away, is 29 (she’s 21, I’m 22), and wants absolutely nothing to do with her; or about how little she’s eaten that day and how she wants to be skinny or calls herself fat (she’s smaller than I am). I’ve struggled with anorexia since high school and all this talk about food and restricting has really triggered my ED. I know she can’t control an ED, I know this given my history, but her talking about it constantly makes me want to stop eating altogether. As fucked up as it sounds, I’m glad I’m losing weight, but I know I’m not doing it the healthy way. 

It’s just such a toxic environment and I can’t wait for my fucking lease to be up so I don’t have to see her again. 

TLDR: roommate has turned into an egotistical maniac, can’t take about anything except herself, and now I’m struggling with my eating disorder again.",relationships
"The last time I saw my ex, we were still together, but he was admitting he was having issues with our relationship. It was not related to another woman, so he said, but he was just having ""personal"" problems he was having to deal with and he didn't know how much longer he could continue on with me.

My ex suffers from mild depression, and has had some financial and professional troubles which I believe is the root of all of it. When we first met, he was at a longtime job, which...while not paying a lot, offered a decent amount of stability. He was on an upward trajectory toward running the company someday...years down the road, though. When we met, he was so much happier and into the relationship. I don't know if things started going downhill when the job started going downhill or the newness of our relationship wore off...maybe both.

In any case, he had some insecurities about where the business was going in general, so he moved on to another company, one that paid better and had better benefits. Which was nice for a little while, but ultimately, he realized he didn't like the job, didn't like the people. He's still there, but for the last year or so, he's been taking classes, trying side jobs...but nothing has really stuck. My interpretation, from speaking to him, and how events have unfolded is that at this point in his life, he feels he should have an established career path, and something he loves doing, and a purpose in life.

Which brings things back to ""us."" As all of this has happened, our relationship has suffered as well. The more and more unfulfilled he has been professionally, the worser our relationship has fared. So, as I said, the last time we talked, he voiced some personal issues that he was having, didn't specify them, but just cited them. Later on, I found out that his company had lost quite a few accounts, and that added a lot of stress on to him.

In the middle all of this, Covid happened. It was at that point we really had no idea when we would see each other again. 2 weeks? 2 months? A year? There was no end to it in sight. I would try to talk to him about ""when this is all over..."" but he never really replied with any sort of encouragement. Until finally, he broke it off. The breakup itself was relatively civil. No yelling, no crying. He didn't really give me a reason why, other than what he told me before, that he was just not in a good place. He said he had no opposition to spending time together as friends, but he didn't want to be intimate.

I was upset, of course, but because he has prepared me for it the last time, I wasn't shocked or blindsided, so I took it pretty well. I started...well I wouldn't say ""seeing"" other people, because ya know...Covid. But, I did start speaking to guys on the dating sites and just getting out there, so to speak. Which was fine. But, with the quarantine, nothing could really go anywhere. In the meantime, ex and I would talk once or twice a week. Not romantically at all....just as friends.

Well, over the last couple of weeks, our conversations have picked up. I would like to see him again, as friends. He is still quarantining, but the stay at home stuff is probably going to wind down over the next few weeks. Last night I put something out there, just to see if he was picking up what I was putting down. He didn't.

I mentioned this great place we had always talked about going. Multiple bedrooms, so it would easily work for a friends only getaway. His only response was ""Yeah, I need to go there sometime."" He then mentioned that he was itching to go to the beach. But...no mentioning of doing anything together.

How do I get him to the point of spending time together again? He said he wanted to spend time together during the breakup. Over the last couple of weeks, he's been friendly, flirty, and attentive. Do I just need to give him more time, and keep doing what we're doing? Pull away?

TL;DR Ex who broke up with me, and doesn't seem very established in life and mentally unsettled, is coming back around. How do I get him back to a good spot so we can see each other as friends?",relationships
"We have a large age gap, but that doesn't bother me. Nor does it bother him. We have a lot in common and bonded very quickly. He travels a lot for work, but has brought me with him several times while traveling. 

For the first 6 months things were going well, but I noticed him start to be jealous of any other man in my life, even co-workers. This was kind of annoying but we worked through it because I am willing to understand.
 We decide to travel across the country, where he has a friend who lives there. The friend (40 M) and his wife (40 F) are very friendly. My boyfriend begins to have jealous feelings when I am conversing with his friend. Fast forward a couple of days and we are running with said friend. 
My boyfriend takes off really fast on a steep uphill, at the beginning of the run and I, being playful, think he is trying to play a joke or maybe impress me. He stops at the stop to catch his breath and I take the inside line and pass him. This knocks him off balance and he injures his knee. (his knee was already hurting prior to this, I just thought he was feeling fine based off of how he took off running). He injures himself and injures his pride a little too. 

For the next 6 months, our relationship is extremely rocky. He is jealous of every other guy I speak to, blames me for injuring him on purpose and having a crush on the friend. We had travels planned to another country where he spoke the language and I didn't. He said he felt like a tour guide and stopped speaking in English to me. He was extremely stressed out and clearly not his best self. 

He was acting like the victim. Every time I cried about the situation and my confusion, he closed up and said that me crying is causing him to not be able to open up to me. I started to feel like I was doing something wrong because we would always have these stupid fights. But it seemed as if my point would never get across that I didn't want to  be with anyone else, etc. 

At this point, I am at my limit and am home again. He is traveling and I am at my complete breaking point and end the relationship. He convinces me to give me another chance when he came to my city when the virus hit and rented an apartment for a month. 

The first time I visited him, I left right away after just realizing that I am more hurt by everything than I could consider. I tell him I want to take things very slow again and make sure it's healthy. I visit 5 or 6 times in the month, but due to the quarantine, I don't see him often. And I definitely wasn't going to stay with him. 

We are on better terms, but he says I ghosted him for a month.  The past couple of weeks he has been upset and barely speaking to me. He is clearly hurt that I didn't visit him as often as anticipated. All of a sudden he is back to normal and calling me pet names. Back to normal? 

Last night we spoke and I was upset after a week of non-communication. Just because I don't want to continue this cycle we are seemingly stuck in. 

I care about him and when things are good between us, we have an amazing relationship and conversation.  I am just looking for some guidance right now. I am at a complete turning point. I lost my job and am in between careers. I have a little savings, but after just moving again, things are really tight. I am not sure I want to continue with this relationship. He is truly amazing in his work and in a lot of ways. I love him, but I don't know what to do next. 

**tldr:
My boyfriend has been having non-stop communication and jealously issues for the past 6 months. It started with an accident while running that caused him to blame me for his injuries. He says he never expected to have to ""watch his back"" with a partner. I felt guilty and stayed, but finally broke down. We are stuck in a really shitty cycle.",relationships

Hey everyone,

First post so please excuse me if I don't have the correct formatting or something like that. To keep things short, my ex and I broke up about 3 months ago, and I just can't seem to get over her. We started dating in December but she broke up with me in February (2 month relationship)

&amp;#x200B;

I realised afterwards that she never really had feelings for me as she didn't even have feelings for me before dating. Her juvenile view on the relationship was ""you like me so I should like you"". This really hurt because she was the first person I truly fell in love with. Regardless, I have accepted what has happened, and I don't feel bad about it. Some things happened afterwards, including me telling her to rot in hell (bad move), but it doesn't really matter because I told her I don't want to be friends beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

 My issue though is that I have to see her everyday at school, including a couple of classes., and it's driving me crazy. I can't get her out of my head, and just when I think I have, something happens that brings it all back to me. I have tried distracting myself with different means, and while I'll admit that it helped temporarily, it didn't do much in the long run.

"Backstory: Mum (47), sister (21 today) me (23).


When I was 15, I went through a rough patch where I fell in with the wrong people, self-harmed a bit, lost all my friends and lost myself. I don’t think I’ve recovered since, I’ve been anxious, have low self-esteem and overthink everything. I have IBS and don’t put myself in social situations often because I’m always scared I’ll have to leave for the toilet.


My sister is such a shining star, she has better grades (mine are good too), she’s always had a great pack of friends surrounding her (I don’t speak to anyone from my secondary school) and she tries hard to advance in her career (accounting - always doing internships, travelling with companies etc). I chose a degree that I ended up not liking and am now stuck thinking about what to do (even though I graduated two years ago).


We’ve definitely always been in competition for our mum's love. I moved away from home a few years ago and have become distant from them. My sister still goes home all the time (during uni holidays) and her and mum go on spa days together, are always watching movies together and I’m feeling so left out.


I’ve been pretty depressed since September 2019 because I don’t have a career focus and was unemployed until February 2020. Since they are both hanging out so much, they’ve been influencing each other a lot. They are both really into positive thinking and read books like “Think and Grow Rich”, watch Bob Proctor events, Tony Robbins documentaries etc. I can’t stand the positive thinking idea and find it really cringe-y because it just seems fake to me.


For the past few months, I’ve been distancing myself from both of them because they’ve been irritating me so much telling me ‘just think positive and everything will fall into place’, ‘everything works out in the end and if it doesn’t work out, it isn’t the end’.


Both of them have taken to social media and start posting stories every day about the power of positive thinking and how to change your mindset. I don’t see the stories because I don’t use social media but the idea of it annoys me so much.


I stopped talking to my sister in mid-February after she tried to correct my French (even though my French is better than hers because I lived in France).


It’s my sisters birthday today and she received so many happy birthday messages from her friends, mum is having a virtual party for her with friends and family. I just can’t bring myself to say happy birthday to her.


This will all seem so petty but I don’t want to “back down” now. My sister has won and is the perfect daughter with lots of friends and love around her. I’m the miserable sister who doesn’t call because I know they’ve already made up their minds about me so what’s the point?


The truth is that I would love to be able to go home to open loving arms but I just feel too awkward to do it. My mum definitely loves me so much. She tells me all the time. I just feel like this has gone too far to turn back. I feel like I'm stained now and just want to hide away from everyone.


tl;dr: Distanced myself from my sister and mum. Don't know what to do next. I want advice from anyone about what I should do. I feel completely lost.",relationships
"
I’ve actually realized this ever since I met her but  I didn’t know there was a term for it. Let’s call my friend, Rose. I would catch Rose all the time in lies. It was always small lies too, like stuff no one would even think to lie about. One time she told me this one funny story about her mom, and when I went to her house later that week, I told her mom about the story Rose told me, and the mom had no idea what I was talking about. 

Rose is also really flaky. She’s the one who always reaches out first to hangout or make plans, but always backs out at the literal last minute. She one time was planning a party and the day before the party, she texted everyone in a group chat, “Sorry everyone, party’s cancelled. I forgot I’m moving back to (her college state) tomorrow.”

How do you “forget” you’re moving??? 

Because she doesn’t live in the same state as me anymore, I maybe see her 1-4 times a year. We always try to make plans to FaceTime, but she flakes out every time. Her excuses have been:

“I forgot I have to take a test right now”

“My tire blew out and I got stuck on the freeway”

“Sorry I just woke up” (at 4pm)

Or if she doesn’t have an excuse she’ll ghost me for a few days then pretend like nothing has ever happened.

She also lies about who she dates, how many people she dates, hookups, etc. Not that I care or have asked about it, she just talks about it on her own. She claims to have a crazy ex that she has a restraining order against, but won’t stop talking about him and how much they talk to each other (when she already said she blocked him on everything) 

The only hurtful thing she’s ever done to me was throw a party and not invite me, even though she claims I’m her best friend. Of course when I found out about the party, I asked her why wasn’t I invited, and she completely back pedaled and lied and said she texted me, but obviously that never happened. If she has a problem with me, she’s never communicated that to me.

For some reason our whole friendship (6 years) I’ve just brushed it off. But tonight kinda got me thinking, and I think this was the final straw. We hadn’t FaceTimed in probably a year because she flakes out every time, but tonight we finally scheduled one.

Five minutes before our scheduled FaceTime call, she texts me “I’m in the hospital. I had a seizure.”

I’m tired of her lies. I want to cut her off, but I know she’ll go crying to everyone we know and spread untrue rumors. I don’t know why she lies exactly, but if I were to guess, it’s for attention. She has good qualities like she’s always helped me through personal issues and has always been there for me, but the LYING is just....ugh. Idk if I should confront her and help her, or just cut her off.

TL;DR: I’m always catching my best friend in lies, to the point where’s she’s lying about being in the hospital. I’ve had enough.",relationships
"*posted by my daughter on my account so that no one finds it*

I (27F) am pretty sure my boyfriend (29M) is cheating on me, possibly with his ex. We’ve lived together for 2 years now, and in the last 6 months things have changed dramatically.

He gets annoyed with me for every little thing (not throwing out food that just started to go bad today, feeding the dog one hour later than usual, etc.) and is constantly on his phone.

He never shows me anything on his phone anymore or let’s me play music on it. He also goes for long walks alone each day.

There’s a literal quarantine going on and he’s often gone walking then getting food (all at once so he’s sometimes gone for hours). I also noticed he’s recently become Facebook friends with his ex.

He’s been talking to the whole group he was friends with when he was with her that she’s also in. This group was very angry when they broke up, so they drifted apart when we started dating. I’ve also heard him mention her name on zoom with this group, but I can’t tell if she’s on the zoom. If she was, the respectful thing would be to tell me.

He’s never cheated before but we have had problems with him talking to his ex after we were dating. Working through those problems, he cut her off completely, but she’s never stopped wanting something back.

He sometimes leaves his phone in the living room while he showers (I’m usually in the bedroom but will come out and see it), but he has an Apple Watch too. Would something pop up on the watch if I look at his phone? Like, if I open messages, will messages be open on his watch then too? I really don’t want him to find out until I can confirm what’s going on. Should I even be checking?

I’ve already tried confronting him, saying that things feel different and that I think somethings going on. He denied all of it and said he’s just annoyed being with me 24/7.

TL:dr; I think my boyfriend is cheating and want to check his phone.",relationships
"The thing is I cannot even get angry because my mother doesn't understand. She has low emotional intelligence and doesnt see the problem of saying what she thinks anywhere public or private. If she feels angry or doesn't like a trait about you she would tell you right there it doesn't matter there are people around you know, in school or anywhere public. She would scream and say what's on her mind. And then if my mother feels she still hasn't expressed her feelings about anything that she is disappointed or angry at she would complain to anyone that listens. Friends. Neighbours. School teachers. Postman. To us (her children). Anyone that has ears. Tell them all her issues regardless if they care or not and she doesn't seem to get that you cannot tell personal matters of your children or spouse or anything that is classified private to others like that. 


Growing up I was embarrassed of my mother because I knew I had to be careful with my words so she don't bring up my past mistakes or say something humiliating about me. Hence I was a good kid in school. Rarely got in trouble. Learned my lesson in a weird way. Didn't want the whole school knowing about my family problems thanks to my mother if the school called her. 


She would even talk about my dad in a negative way if he does something wrong and if he doesn't apologise she would go on and on telling anybody that would listen even her own children about how shit of a partner our dad is and if she could go back in time she would have rejected him. Things like that and other things we should not really know about. 


My mother hasn't matured, she argues with my siblings and creates a ruckus if things do not go her way and becomes very unreasonable. She would even go as low and insult one of my siblings who has mental illness if she is fed up with them. My mother has no boundaries when she feels she is been attacked or is in a rage mode. Idk what I could do. When she is in a good mood she is lovely but you just cannot trust her really because once her mood goes down she will use it against you. Even with children she shows no mercy. Her poisonous tongue knows no restriction. 

Tldr: Mum has low emotional intelligence and says whatever she wants even at the expense of others. Doesnt have boundary either. Anything is free game if she feels threatened or is in a defensive position.",relationships
"My ex broke up with me last year in October. Alot has happened in the past few months, during the break up she's moved country and I've moved into the City with a new job.

Since the breakup, we was talking every other day still until around Janurary, when she moved away and I had the first interview for the new job. I then stopped initiating as it was really getting me down (I ended up in a bad state mid december) and she would contact me minimum once a week asking about family, and some random thing that happened. She would also ask to borrow money twice before she went away and whilst away.

I started my new job in February and I started to feel much better about everything, I started talking with someone I have alot of the same intrests in, and met a couple of times which went well (Ofcourse the Lockdown hasn't helped with this person, but we still talk everyday). However, she would still contact me and the feelings are still there on my side, this is when I let her know for a second time that I find it hard to talk. She would carry on again.

I had to block her the other day, I didn't want to get to that but its the only thing that could help me. All her social media was now gone, and today I woke up to a text message from a random number asking if I blocked her (I deleted her phone number and all the messages when I blocked her, so Im not sure if its the same number or a new one as I didnt block the number), along with her saying she hopes we are all fine.

I've told her again why I did it (Find it hard seeing/talking to her), and she said she understands, and said sorry again. But its like she's not understanding it. Shes trying to start conversations and just keeps saying sorry when I say Im finding it hard, I'm a bit lost in what to do, I know shes moving back home after the lockdown, thats about it.

TL:DR;

Ex broke up with me in October, still talked regularly until janurary when she moved country. I'm finding it hard talking to her and let her know multiple times and had to block her on social media the other day. Shes still messaging me after I've told her again why.",relationships
"He is having a really rough time, with final exams and other problems, making him terribly frustrated and angry with anything and anyone. He is calm and rational as a person, but now he has episodes of self harm, self hate and irrational behavior.

 He doesn't know how to deal with it and I don't know how to help him. We're students so we can't really afford to seek professional help, because it's expensive and it's hard to find someone suitable in our country.

Also parents would only make it worse, so it feels like a dead end. I don't know what to do, especially that he is hurting me as well sometimes and I don't want to fight no more.

"Hi, so ill just start off by saying that I met an amazing girl who I've been dating for a while now, and for the most part everything is great. I love her, she loves me, and we seem to be doing really great together. 

My issue stems from the fact that this is my first real girlfriend, and she has had a lot of past experiences and things happen. While I dont really care as long as its not brought up unless relevant or she needs to share some past issues, there have been lots of small mentions of exes that any other person wouldn't bat an eye at, but whenever I hear about them I just clam up. I dont know who they are, i don't know how they were apart from apparently quite abusive, but at the same time I have these imaginary figures in my head I'm constantly comparing myself too. I've mentioned before that I'm not too interested in hearing about them unless she feels the need to tell me something specific for the stated reasons above, but mentions do happen and when they do, i just kind of panic and can't think. Plus I can't really deal well with any of her past sexual experiences being brought up, as then I become super self conscious about myself, size, performance, etc. Add on top of that i cant ejaculate during sex with her and im already starting in a poor spot mentally. She has assured me I'm perfect but at the same time, you will say that to anyone if you love them and don't want to hurt them. 

Im a super jealous person as well, and one of the things brought up recently was the topic of anal. She said that she had a past experience that scared her from that forever, and along with the mention of her sexual past causing me to clam up from jealousy now I can only think of this ex who fucked up and is standing between me and this thing I had a mild interest in trying. I wouldnt be so caught up on this if it hadnt been done before, but the idea in my mind of someone getting there before me and walling that off forever is kind of really fucking with me. If it was just an aversion in general without trying it at all, I'd be fine and go off on my merry way, but the fact that someone else fucked up and im on the receiving end of it along with my anxiety of comparisons is just making me stressed out. I'd never do anything to harm her or force her into doing anything, but the mental weight of it, the fact that it feels now as if I dont get to experience her completely, and knowing someone else has is really making me super stressed out and kind of tearing me apart a bit. I know i probably sound like an absolute jackass here, but on top of the stress of not being able to ejaculate and being sexually frustrated by that, my self image issues and mental comparisons, I feel like I dont know what to do with myself. Im not going to have anal be the hill i die on especially because I dont want to strong-arm her into doing something she doesn't want based on my issues as that would make me worse than the exes, but at the same time all the mental comparisons built up and happened to explode on this anal alamo. Again, sorry if this is all super dumb and stuff, but I just want help figuring out how to get over this and move forward with my girlfriend without hanging on the ex issue and my mental freakout. Thanks.


Tl;dr this is my first real relationship I lost my virginity in and I have serious jealousy issues whenever exes get brought up, as I mentally compare myself to them and how good they were in bed, how big, etc and clam up for a while after every mention. I cant ejaculate during sex or at all with her, causing more mental stress. The topic of anal came up and I learned a past ex scared her away from that forever, and knowing I cant experience her completely and someone else has is turning my anxiety and stress into 5th gear.",relationships
"I (27f)recently ended a relationship because I saw no future in it. 

I obviously am still hurting because I love him and I will take my time before jumping into another relationship. 

However, I really dislike the expectations that I should take up to a year to be single to find myself before going into another relationship. 

I have found myself I know what I like and what I don’t like. Honestly I love being in a relationship I love spoiling my partner, making their birthday special, and having a mutual support in the relationship.

I do not like being alone not because I cannot. I perfectly am independent: I have a very good paying job, my own nice place and many friends. I just prefer to be in a relationship because I really like the feeling. 

 Am I in the wrong here?

"This may sound crazy but just hear me out. 

I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for around 4 years now. We started dating in high school but are in a long distance relationship since he moved to another country because of the uni that he chose. He has a younger sister who has just turned 20 who lives in the same country as him as they go to the same uni. 

I love his family dynamics, I love and respect his parents a lot but his mom has a really tough exterior so I don’t really know if she likes me. His dad is a real funny guy. However his sister, I sometimes feel like he cares so much more about his sister than he does about me which I completely understand but sometimes I feel like I deserve more of the attention too?

He’d have his days where he would talk about how bad he feels about his sister during this quarantine and that she doesn’t have anything to do. But when I go to him about my problems, he just goes: I’m sorry I can’t do much. Just know I’ll be praying for you. Let me know how it goes. Like I know this distance makes everything hard, like he can’t give me physical affirmation but I’m just wanting more than that?

When they’re back home and me and him goes out on dates, I’d invite her every once in a while so she doesn’t feel lonely at home and she’d come along. But he’d pay a ton of attention to her, I know he just doesn’t want her to feel left out but I’m just ????? 

This one sounds super embarrassing to say but everytime he goes out with me he rarely updates his social media but when he’s out with her, he would post snapchats about her. This sounds fuuucked up but sometimes I feel like why can he treat his sister like that but he doesn’t treat me like that??

It’s his sister’s birthday today and he’s super hyped up about it cos he got her an Apple Watch. And I just noticed how shitty he treated me on my birthday a couple months back since he broke up a week before it and his sister didn’t even wish me a happy birthday lol. He didn’t even get me a birthday gift!!!! Technically we were broken up but I freaking love birthdays and my heart kinda still breaks thinking about how shitty of a birthday I had this year lol

I have no clue whether his sister likes me or hates me. But I’ve been thinking about it his actions a lot lately and I just don’t know what to do. 

Should I even say something about it? Am I being an asshole about all this? 

Somebody call me out please

"Hubby and I have been together for 9 years, married three. He's always done this and I've always blamed myself for being oversensitive but lately I'm wondering if I have a right to demand that he stop. 

Examples: if he makes the slightest mistake, like accidentally breaking a wineglass, knocking over a bottle of pills so they spill, burning dinner, etc - he flips out on himself. Starts yelling and cursing, saying how he's stupid, can't do anything right ever, sometimes throws things/slams doors/similar behaviors in frustration. The kind of thing where if he had that reaction to me making a similar mistake, it'd be cut and dry abusive, but to be clear he has never done it toward me, just himself.

The problem is, I grew up in an abusive household, and whenever this happens, all my little lizard brain can grasp is: ""Out of control angry man run hide avoid danger danger danger."" It's like I can't process that it isn't directed at me. I've been in therapy off and on for years and put a lot of work into managing this response, and I have some tools to deal with it when it happens, but it still happens. Then he sees my face and gets all guilty and miserable. For what it's worth he's always really remorsefully and apologetic after. 

I guess my thought is...shouldn't a 30-year-old man have a better grip on himself than this? Am I unreasonable to think that yelling and cursing and throwing things around the room is an unacceptable response to what are honestly small problems? Especially given that he knows about my past? He says he just needs to vent, and this is how he lets his frustrations out. It's never AT me. So I feel unreasonable for wanting him to deal with his emotions differently when in theory it has nothing to do with me. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope? 

Tl;dr husband yells, curses, says awful things about himself, and sometimes physically lashes out at inanimate objects in response to his own mistakes. Because of my past, it upsets me badly every time. Can I tell him he needs to stop? How can I deal?",relationships
"Hey, so I'm using a throwaway as she knows my reddit.

My ex and I broke up about 2 months ago, right before lockdown started (UK). The reason for our breakup is a topic of disagreement between us, she blames my low mood and issues related to my depression meaning I have been struggling to be social for a while. To note I am getting treatment and seeing a counsellor, my mood is much better as of late but it's taken a while to get here. I think however that she is lying to me, and she is actually wanting to date someone else.

Here is the bulletpoint version:

- August last year she meets this guy at her climbing gym. They hang out through a group, I think nothing of it until she tells me she's started developing an attraction to him. We work through it and she agrees to only hang out with the group not one on one.
-Christmas eve, I find out this has not been the case, they have been hanging out one on one and she has hidden it from me. She only tells me because on XMAS EVE, they met up to exchange gifts (I thought it was the group) and he declared he was in love with her. We had a fight, she agreed not to see him again and blocks him on her phone on boxing day.
- She spends the next 3 days crying intermittently because of having to block him. I don't understand why, if you give a shit about your relationship, you would ever want that person in your life as what he did was incredibly disrespectful to me, and just plain slimy.
- I find out in mid February, around my birthday, that she has been texting him again, we argue but agree to keep working at it.
- End of March, We break up, she gives me the above excuse as reason 

So, after a period with only necessary contact she now wants to be friends, however I know through a mutual friend, after her swearing up and down for months that she was only interested in friendship with this guy, that she is now seeing him.

I'm now torn between feeling like I still want her in my life, because honestly I still love her, which feels batshit and my friends all think I'm nuts. I'd never date her again but, I don't know, she's been my best friend for 3 years. And on the other hand there is my counsellor, my friends and a voice in my head telling me that she has been gaslighting and manipulating me for months. That our whole relationship was just her using me to build herself up after her ex cheated on her (ironic?). I don't know whether that is just anger or whether my feelings are justified.

This post is a mess, I need advice and needed to vent. Sorry. Ask if you need clarification.

TL;DR My ex wants to be friends but I found out that she has started seeing the guy she spent 6 months having an 'emotional affair' with and now I feel like I've been gaslighted, justifiably?",relationships
"TL;DR my sister upsets me and mom often because of the way how she talks. My mom talked to her about it several times but she always shrugs it off. Should I seriously confront her about this?

So basically I (20yo) am living with my sister (29yo) and my mom.
Whenever my sister talks to mom or me, it often ends up an argument because of the way how she talks. It happens especially between her and mom, like there’s a 80% of chance that my mom will be upset with her.
Usually, it’s because of the way she talks. she talks in a quite straightforward way, but sometimes it comes off rude, impolite and even unnecessarily hurtful. My mom often addresses her about this but she always brushes it off.

Personally, I can see why my mom gets upset with her. For instance when she wants a trash removed from the table, she could ask ‘can you put this trash to the bin?’, but she rather yells ‘seriously hurry up and get this trash off the table already’. She saw I haven’t taken a shower yet (because I was busy doing my homework), she yells ‘seriously you haven’t showered yet? Disgusting’ instead of asking why I haven’t taken a shower yet. She talks little better when talking to mom, but still in a way that upsets her.
Her tone kind of sounds in a condescending and patronizing way. Mom and I don’t really like it and my mom often confronts her about it.

The thing is I feel like she actually talks like that in a lighthearted way, so she doesn’t really mean to upset us. She’s sometimes actually a sweet person and is a responsible person and generally has good morals, which I admire. Obviously she loves our family, but it’s her tone that always makes me and mom upset very often. Maybe we’re too sensitive, I don’t know.

So when my sister and mom get into an argument regarding her speaking manners, I’d like to explain to my sister why mom gets offended and how she should speak. But here’s a thing: I’m afraid to take mom’s side because my sister is the only family member that I have come out to (yeah.. I’m part of LGBT). I fear my sister might think I’m betraying her in a way when she did a favor for me by keeping my gender identity secret to the rest of family. 

I’m particularly worried about this because my mother was mentally unstable a couple of months back. She’s  so much better now, but I don’t think the arguments she keeps having with my sister will good for her. This is another reason why I want to kinda take mom’s side when there’s an argument.

So... what do you think I should do? Should I take my mom’s side when there’s an argument or should I not take anyone’s side at all? Should I seriously confront  her about it (although my mother does it all the time)?

Sorry if there’s something you can’t quite understand because english isn’t my native language. I’m happy to clarify if something didn’t make sense.",relationships
"Imagine this: Your S/O of 9 years starts a new job. Very exciting, and you are so happy and proud of them. But then, they use your facebook to search for a new coworker. Not a big deal. S/O doesn’t have a fb and you are always logged into yours. The catch is that they delete your fb search history - but not your browser history. Then, this new coworker is introduced into daily conversations. Then, said coworker begins snapchatting your S/O constantly, they become each other’s top friends (💛). You confront them about this relationship and how you are uncomfortable with it. They acknowledge. Then, they download wickr. Coworker becomes your S/O’s only wickr contact. Oh, and they change coworkers real username to a “coded” one (took you a second to figure that out). The concern over this is brought up again, and acknowledged. The reasoning for the username change was “to not make you mad that I was talking to them”. Wickr is deleted. One day, S/O is anticipated to come home early from work due to a holiday. They do not get home when expected. Again, not criminal. But when asked about what happened, they say a *different* coworker asked them to come over and assemble an ikea table. You immediately do not believe this. You wait a day and confront S/O and the truth is revealed that the suspect coworker had your S/O over. You are livid. You finally contact said coworker and they deny any feelings and make you feel crazy. You (understandably) get blocked from their only social media. Months go by with the occasional conversation between you and S/O about how to handle this. Boundaries are drawn to only text about work. This doesn’t sit well with you and the desire to snoop continues. At this point you request that S/O blocks all form of communication. You do this yourself on S/O’s phone while they are present. You still don’t trust that they will continue to have this person blocked. What else can you do? 

I know I wrote this in a weird second person-y way, but that’s just how it started to come out. I need help. My marriage is suffering and I’m having trouble pinpointing exactly what to do. I want to stop snooping, but that’s where I got 90% of this information. But how can I stop snooping when my trust continues to be broken? Do I ask to see his phone randomly? I know that can’t be healthy. Every time I find something, I bring it up and I am lied to. I know I’m being lied to because I know the truth from the messages on his phone, but he doesn’t know I know that. I’m sure he’s figured it out by now though. I don’t trust that she will stay blocked in his phone. This is causing both of us anxiety and it’s heartbreaking. We definitely need to go to marriage counseling. Once everything opens back up, hopefully we can get in quickly. 

TLDR; I keep finding things on my husband’s phone leading me to mistrust him. How do I get him to be truthful so I can stop snooping?",relationships
"Context: me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 9 months now and I am super happy with her. We are both in college and we live states apart. Since the pandemic hit we have been apart for about 3 months now, and it is taking a toll on both of us mentally

Like I said me and my girlfriend are separated currently during this. We are states apart. Lately, my girlfriend found out she might not be able to afford the entire 2020-2021 school year. With her parents not having enough to completely cover even the fall semester, it has left her very stressed about what the future holds for her. She may not be able to return to college, and I would be alone at college and states away. I do not feel I am mentally prepared to continue a long distance relationship past this quarantine. I have tried it before and I am just miserable because I crave physical affection and interaction compared to just talking on the phone. I was planning on flying to see her but I just started a summer job at a grocery store and I’m afraid they will be super strict about me requesting a week off (since it’s a Union store). I don’t know what to do.

She has been rightfully very anxious and depressed because of this and I have no clue what to do. I’m not good with words and I don’t want her to feel like I don’t care. I don’t know what to do and this is starting to take a mental toll on both of us to where I don’t have any motivation to do anything I used to enjoy, and the same can be said about her.

"*Background*

My mother has mental health issues and ever since i can remember she would ask me if i did anything with my dad, hugging, kissing, etc. and then when i say no she would claim me to be a liar and as i grew older it definitely grew from threats of disowning me or a “curse” for doing bad things with my dad, to cussing me out.

My dad had it worse than me, my mom would shout at him and accuse him of horrible things, from cheating on her to pedophilia. Only based in that all her accusations against me are false i assume her accusations against my dad aren’t true either. I hardly know my dad despite living in the same house. 

To keep the peace and my mother from another tantrum, id avoid my dad and stay in one place where my mom knows i am at the time or in front of her and far from my dad, i can hardly speak to him without her getting jealous/suspicious. Its gotten to the point that for years now my mom and i share a bed and my dad would share a room with one of my brothers.

Even my own brother placed the responsibility of my mothers calmness and everyone else’s happiness on me. Especially my dad who’s never turned bitter because of my mom but has been driven to depression.

*Virus part*

We don’t know if he has the virus but he was tested and the results are coming in around 6 days. My brother moved out of the room to the couch for my dad and someone prepares meals for him, not me though. 

He’s called me once but i was in the bathroom and my mother was there, i was scared she’d listen and get suspicious again. I have never checked on him at all because of my mom yet she has accused me of doing so behind her back.

I know this hurts my dad maybe even more than me and i do want to make sure he’s okay but I’m scared my mother will only make things worse. I just don’t know what to do. 

TD;LR: my mentally ill mother is emotionally abusive to me and my dad, to the point where i avoid my dad to avoid conflict. However now my dad has the virus and i haven’t checked up on him but i want to but i don’t know how without risking a tantrum from my mother.",relationships

She only pointed the camera for a second there and said sorry I couldn’t hold it. 

I thought it was strange that when I asked she pointed the camera on herself and actually showed her stream coming out. I think she Thought it was funny but I’m also wondering if she has a pee fetish? I found it actually really hot.

he lives in a high cost of living area, and although he makes a decent amount, we’ve talked about how financially stressful this city is for him. i know he struggles with money sometimes and we usually split bills, get each other small meaningful gifts for christmas, birthdays, etc. we help each other out when we can, basically.

well, he really blew me away by buying me a new macbook pro!!! i swear my jaw hit the floor when i saw it. hes easily the most generous and kind person i know, but holy SHIT A NEW LAPTOP!!! it was a mixture of amazement, shock, happiness, and “WTF”.

We've been together for 10 years.  I've gained weight with our kid, but hell, he proposed to me while I was a good 30lbs overweight.  I know he's slept with larger women.
Last night, I was beyond *frisky*. Asked him to prep for bed *wink wink*.  He ends up on the computer (games and online friends) until long after I fell asleep.  The stuff I'd laid out for him in the bathroom was still there today.  ""I'm sorry, but I didnt get to bed till late, and I was tired from staying up.""
Alright.   Tonight, I put my crap away for bed, and go up behind him at his desk.  I hit the chair lightly to get his attention.  He looks up at me with complete irritation.  I told him his stuff was waiting.  Eyeroll.
10 minutes later, he comes into the bedroom and sits on the bed.  ""Honey, tomorrow is mother's day, and I was thinking that, you know, we celebrate that tomorrow night,"" meaning he had no desire to have sex with me until tomorrow night. 
I told him to forget it, and buy a bottle of hand lotion.  I'm over him doing this.  He only wants it when he wants it, and I can literally go fuck myself when I want it.  When he wants it, I'm expected to go running to him.
So, tomorrow, I'm telling him that what I want for mother's day is to find a fuck buddy, and he can go be happy with his computer and hand lotion.

"English isn't my first language, apologies for mistakes

To say shortly, my family has been awful to my girlfriend. While never actually saying a thing to her face, awful things were said to me about her and it led to a whole lot of situations.

* My mother criticized her eating habits (girlfriend likes candy and is complexed by her weight), under the guise of ""worry about her health"". 

* My mother encouraged me to ""open my eyes"" (to other women) and to keep an open spirit (towards other relationships).

* finally she almost admitted to hating her, by a few words.

She said other BS which I don't remember exactly at the moment. I got surprised (my jaw dropped) the first few times and stammered. My mother, who is much sweeter to my SILs was awful to my girlfriend and I got surprised. I defended her each time.

Needless to say, after the initial shock, I had fights with my parents. each time.

Covid forced us to make a move. Being essential workers, my parents tried to capitalize on it to force us to not see each other. ""You're going to get infected"" BS. So we moved in together.

Once again, it was an awful fight with my parents pretty much cutting me off financially (still studying) and cutting a lot of contact. Now, I only get news if I write/call and they barely acknowledge my girlfriend. It's been hard and I've been grieving the fact they weren't as nice as I once believed.

Since then, I learned my girlfriend had confided to friends and her parents. It's fine and I don't mind. Until I heard comments.

* a mutual friend asked her why I didn't defend my girlfriend more.

* Her father insulted my parents in front of me, when it was mentioned my mother had (finally) acknowledged her in an email.

It got me thinking. I know my parents were awful. I suffer from it and grieve. Still, I can't help but doubt myself and ask if I did enough? How were my actions perceived? Was it my cowardice that warranted them to say such things? (Cowardice as in  I was shocked and stunned the first few times my mother acted out)

Asking my girlfriend led to partial answers. ""Not my relationship with them. It's your family. You do as you want"", the fact it had all changed since we moved in together and that I didn't depend on them anymore. She ran in circles and avoided clear answers when I asked her for what she thought of how I had acted in order to gauge my future actions.

I feel stuck. I get how she doesn't want to be implicated in my decisions concerning my family, but I can't help but want her input. I don't want her to resent me because I disappointed her by not defending her enough. Or going too far, if that's possible..?

Tl;dr: parents were awful to my girlfriend. We moved in together and they seem to resent us, especially her. Asking for her input on how I should act with them, girlfriend avoids answering.",relationships
"Hi, I’m(F19) dating a man(M20) that I really love. However, I’m still dealing with past trauma from an ex that was very mentally and sexually abusive towards me. I lost so much of my self-confidence, femininity, and ability to communicate my emotions well during that relationship. I really felt like the shell of a person. I went to therapy for around 6 months, and I really felt like I was able to mostly move on and feel normal again. I reconnected with the current guy I’m dating, who I’ll call Joe, when I went back to university. We knew each other in high school and were friends, so I felt comfortable with him. We began dating eventually, and he’s an amazing person. I just feel so bad for Joe having to date me. I really don’t think I’ve gotten over my past relationship, and have started relapsing into my mental state before therapy. I keep getting flashbacks to what my ex did to me or the slightest trigger will set me off, and it makes me so emotionally volatile. This has been happening especially during quarantine because I can’t overstimulate my mind with my sorority, classes, clubs, and other stuff that kept me busy. I’m so trapped in my mind right now. I feel like I’m hurting him when I have outbursts and I apologize and try to explain myself, and he always forgives me and says we all have things we need to overcome and that we can get through it together. I feel like such a bad person for blaming anything on my mental state because it just feels so manipulative, but I really don’t want to be hurting him and I hope I’m not. My mind just keeps telling me I’m not good enough for him, that he could be cheating on me, that I should break up with him, and so many other crazy things that I know aren’t true. I just don’t know if I’m emotionally stable enough be in a relationship right now. I don’t want to hurt him or be a burden to him, but I really don’t want to lose Joe. 

I’m sorry if this post was messy, I’m just not thinking/writing clearly at the moment. I know I need to go back to therapy, and I’m going to reach out to my previous therapist soon and hopefully do video chat sessions. I just really wanted to rant to people that I don’t know. Thank you to anyone that reads this.

"My girlfriend (F18) and I,(M18) have been together for a year now. I'll try to keep this simple.
I really love my girlfriend and this has nothing to do with her. Basically, she has a ""boy best friend"" who she's known for a while. I've accepted that they are just friends and nothing more but what worries me is that when she is around both of us is that she always choses to laugh and poke fun at him as if they were together, almost like flirting. I trust her enough that she won't cheat on me and I can't imagine it happening. I feel like I am somehow the third wheel when this happens. 

I've learnt to accept many facts such as they've known each other longer and have that special bond. I just wish that when we have a problem she'd talk to me instead of him and we could work things out together instead of him having to inform me that something is wrong. I just want to make her laugh and smile as much as he does and I do try my hardest to make her happy but he is always one step ahead. I know that I'm the one she has accepted as her boyfriend, but I'm not quite sure why. It's like they both still have lingering feelings for each other and she's only dating me because he got a girlfriend and I'm acting as a rebound. Sometimes I ask her about how they are doing and she'd reply with ""That's none of your business"", which in my opinion is totally understandable but makes me feel some way I cannot explain.

I know I may sound stupid but knowing there is someone who can make her more happy and she can potentially have or had feelings for makes me uncomfortable a little. I've never told her this because it's a problem I have to resolve with myself. 
We do have our time together which we really enjoy but when he is around the feeling totally shifts as if I don't exist anymore. Keep in mind her boy best friend is also taken, but they both act in such a way you'd think that they are with each other.

I am the jealous type, but the not the angry one. When I get jealous I mean that there is someone making her more happy and I get kind of sad. Even when I am around, they both poke fun at me like I'm some kind of target and I feel really insecure. They think it's just jokes but it really hurts me sometimes. 

This a problem with me and she definitely doesn't mean to cause all this, she's a very caring person.

I know that I am young and overthinking a lot of things but I just want to be a great boyfriend and make her happy too. I also want her to have freedom and knows I trust her, so I wouldn't make her stop spending time with him.

Maybe I am just an insecure fool and this whole thing is in my head, I'm open for any suggestions on how to improve. 

TL;DR- I am uneasy about my girlfriend's ""boy best friend"" and want to make her as happy but the way they act together makes me uncomfortable.",relationships
"TL;DR I worry for my ex(depression) post break up, and wonder if I should allow calling or agree to cut ties.

The reason I'm(23M) asking this is because my ex(22F) shared with me years ago that she had depression/cutting tendencies and about losing people important in her life. She's a sweetheart, introverted and only opens up to people whom she really trusts. We needed to break up because(mainly) of her family's religious disapproval of me (atheist, but they basically disapproves of anyone except of theirs, obsolete yes) and she understands that. We agreed to end it post college.

We didn't really say anything when college ended. She moved back to her country and we still chat, but it became less frequent. I wanted to bring up our status when she came back to visit, but she avoided the topic. 

The thing is she ghosts me, and reappears, and ghosts me, and reappears again. It wasn't too long ago (2weeks)that she appeared in my dm to tell me about her new found hobby in this quarantine/family stuffs/insecurities, but after that she continues the ghosting again.

Finally, called her to clarify our status and she agrees that we are friends. But she also said if you don't want me talking to you ever, just tell me.

To me, I don't mind either way; I've gotten used to the ghosting but if she needs a friend I'm always there. She's fun to chat with. As long as she clarifies that we are friends. 

She seems to be coping well, but again because of what she shared, I'm not sure. Am I worrying too much?",relationships
"ThrowRA: I (F20) started to talk to a guy (M19) that I met on Tinder during quarantine about a month and a half ago. We were talking to each other 24/7 and used to video chat everyday. Obvious, we got attached pretty quickly to each other and started to think about dating. However, we got into a misunderstanding and he decided that we would be better off as friends because we don’t have the same views on some things but we do have a lot in common.

It’s been almost a week and since then, we only sent each other one message per day. He has been a bit cold lately and answers me every 20h or so. Because of that, I asked him if he really wanted us to be friends or was it just to be nice. He told me that he meant it but just thought that he would give me some space. 

Because it is still a bit new, I am still attached to him and I see him as more than a friend. That is why I am trying to distance myself a bit. I also try to not answer quickly so I won’t fall back into it (I usually answer him before I go to bed).  I am just wondering if he is maybe trying to do the same thing or it is because he really doesn’t care anymore and has completely moved on. I get that things are over and I am trying my best to not have any hope but I do not want to start being friends with someone that’s not willing to put in the effort. 

Therefore, I am wondering if anyone has ever been in my situation and/or a similar one and how did that turn out for you? Do you think we have a shot at being friends or does it seems dead to you? Thank you!:)

TL;DR Started talking to a guy, he thought we would be better off as friends but he became cold.",relationships
"Because of the quarantine, I (28M) have been spending a lot more time with my girlfriend (27F). We met through online dating a year ago, and became serious/exclusive about 6 months ago. We live in a big city in America.

We don't live together, but since the lockdowns began, our system has been to spend a few days together at one of our homes in order to minimize traveling. Because of this, I've been around her more and have noticed her drinking habits. I've realized that I feel a little uncomfortable with how much she drinks.

On an average night, she'll have 3-5 drinks, usually beer. She doesn't drink every night, but it seems to me like the main limiting factor is if there is beer in the fridge or not. If we have any, then it's pretty likely she'll drink it. She's much more likely to drink if she's stressed. For example, while studying for exams, she drank more. If she's socializing (either with roommates or on zoom), she'll generally drink more -- maybe closer to 7-9 drinks. I think it takes around 3 or 4 drinks for her to become drunk, obviously depending on food, pace, etc. It's pretty rare for her to blackout, and maybe 20% of the time she'll get a hangover.

Don't know if it's relevant, but around 50-60% of nights she'll get high with weed too. The effects it has on her are similar to alcohol, except maybe with more paranoia and talkativeness (nothing too drastic). I enjoy drinking and getting high occasionally, but probably more like once or twice a week. Her smoking has a similar effect on me, but I'd say it's less of an issue.

**Why does this make me uncomfortable?**

* I grew up in a no alcohol family. I didn't drink in college, and only started drinking around 2 years ago when I was 26. I don't have much experience with the ""norms"" of drinking.
* Once I did start drinking, I've had my own share of issues around feeling pressure to drink while on dates or with romantic partners. (I never had an issue with that when I avoided alcohol entirely.) So I've noticed that when she's drinking as a matter of routine, I sometimes feel compelled to join her when there's no way I ever would have had anything if I were alone. (More often than not, it does end up being a nice hangout activity.)
* Throughout college and after, I've had plenty of friends and roommates who drink. I don't feel weird or peer pressure around them. They drink less than my SO. My ex also only drank very occasionally.
* She has told me that she uses alcohol and weed as coping mechanisms. I was never one to rely on substances to deal with life's stresses. I want to be sensitive to the ways a person chooses to deal with life, so I don't want to dismiss the benefits of substances entirely. I do want to make sure that she has a healthy approach to using them for this purpose.
* When she's drunk (or really high), she's less fun for me to be around. She becomes more forgetful, so she may initiate plans that she forgets about entirely the next day. She becomes more erratic conversationally, so she'll jump between different topics in a few sentences, or not really absorb what I'm saying because she's thinking about something else. Sometimes, she becomes more anxious (she takes Zoloft for anxiety), and gets very worried about how I'm feeling or that I'm upset with her. This is most likely her picking up on the fact that I'm uncomfortable with the drinking, but interpreting it as annoyance.
* The day after drinking heavily, she'll often say she was ""tipsy"" when in fact I perceived her to be visibly drunk. Downplaying intoxication seems like an orange flag to me -- it's like she's ashamed of it. My guess is that she might feel judged or criticized because she can sense that I'm uncomfortable.

By the way, all the numbers and percentages above are more gut feeling than anything. I haven't been rigidly monitoring her habits since that feels creepy and overbearing. But I feel like I've noticed a pattern and my feelings, so I'm here now.

My brain is telling me that her habits really don't seem that extreme, and the fact I'm uncomfortable with this is more my problem than hers. E.g., I'm not aware of anyone else in her family or friends circle who feels uncomfortable -- but on the other hand, no one else spends nearly as much time with her as I have been recently.

I love her very much, so just looking for ways to work through this and talk about this with her. Is this just an area where I may not be compatible with her? And sanity check: is this healthy behavior of hers? (Again, my brain says yes, but my gut says no for some reason.) How can I make I make her feel less judged, but still let her know how I feel? Is there anything I should watch out for?

**TL;DR: I'm around my girlfriend's drinking more and I'm uncomfortable with it because she becomes more forgetful and anxious, she downplays her drinking, and she uses drinking to cope with stress. I think this seems more like my problem than hers. How can I let her know how I feel without judging her?**",relationships
"I am in a painful situation and any help will be appreciated.  

I recently ended things with my ex of 2 and a half years.  I always did my best to take care of her, and satisfy all her needs.  In turn, my needs were not satisfied to what they needed to be to make me happy.  The sex was amazing, we had no issues there.  However, I had no space to myself.  I would regularly work 45-60 hour weeks, she is a student that just graduated (in three years) on track for med school. She worked as a cocktail waitress over the weekends, she is absolutely stunning, I mean drop-dead gorgeous.  I would pick her up at 2:30-3 am on the weekends and get around 5 hours of sleep until the next morning when I would head to work.  This cycle would continue and I should have stood my ground and said that the lack of sleep is killing me but I didn't.  I have already learned so much about what a healthy relationship is and how being a man isn't about holding in feelings, but voicing them out with your SO.  We were living together, while I was paying rent on another place with a few roommates.  I never stayed at the place I was paying rent on, only visited. I was always over at her place because it made her happy.  I knew that I needed space and so I would voice out on multiple occasions that I wanted to spend one day over at my other place.  She would usually ask who I was sleeping with, accusing me of cheating.  Example: She had my location on hand in an app.  I was at my place one day and she took a screenshot of the GPS and accused me of being somewhere I wasn't, to when I sent her a photo of me and my roommate.  So, I let myself get run over. 

After speaking with my sponsor, my therapist, parents, friends, I made the decision to separate.  I made sure that the way I was feeling would not pass and that this was the healthiest decision for both of us.  Who wants their SO to be miserable in a relationship.  It was one of the most difficult things I've had to do.  This woman helped me get into treatment and stop using hard drugs.  We have had so many amazing memories together.  Thing is, I didn't have an identity.  All of the things that I used to have before, my music hobbies, games, friends, were all self-neglected. I did not know who I was and what made me ME...other than her.  I felt that this separation could not only heal me, but maybe make her more independent, enough so that maybe we could make things work in the future. 

The moment that I ended things she deleted all our photos on social media, told me that she wasted the last 2 and a half years of her life, and said that she never trusted me from the beginning.  I knew that she was upset and it came out that she didn't mean anything over the wasted time.  However, the truth was, she really didn't trust me one bit, right from the start.  Her previous two ex-boyfriends both cheated on her which I know would cause trust issues.  I would bring up the fact that I am not them, that I am sober, I work very hard, and I go to online school in the meantime...but she still wouldn't trust me.  I could never understand this, my brain works to trust someone until they give you a reason to not.

Today I found out in my account activity that she has constantly been logging on as me on both my main social media accounts (do not know how she got that info).  She also had blocked several women that were a part of my life a long time ago that she must have seen as ""threatening"".  I never thought that any of them compared to her beauty and intelligence, she thought differently.  At first I didn't feel the need to do anything, almost a comforting feeling that she knows I didn't do anything to hurt her.  Then I realized that having my account information wouldn't help us in the future.  I reset the passwords on both accounts and logged out of all other access points.  Not only this but one of my buddies told me that I shouldn't be talking to her because she is talking to someone else and might be setting me up.  He's her best friends boyfriend and we bonded really well.  He said she didn't deserve me and to move on.  I still have very strong feelings and deeply want things to work.    Why now more than every do I want to make things work and come back. I think the best decision may be no contact for an extended period of time.

TL;DR:  I ended a long term relationship over the distrusting and controlling nature of my ex, after expending all other options, in hopes that we may be able to work things out in the future.  I found out she had access to my socials from the beginning of our relationship and never trusted me from the beginning.  I still love her deeply, should I rekindle things and try to work things out from inside the relationship, should I distance myself more and hope for the best, or should I GTFO.",relationships
"I'm at my wits end honestly. He refuses to give me personal space. I'm Autistic, and only really like my wife touching me in any way. But our roommate, her friend, constantly touches me and hugs me and ignores whenever I tell him to not do so. In fact, he finds it funny to make me angry by touching me.

Just 30 minutes ago he ""jokingly"" came to touch me with a shoe, knowing it would make me angry. I gave him clear instructions to not touch me, and that I don't want to be touched in any way. He faked out doing it a few times and then smacked me with the shoe and ran off cackling. This is the petulant child I have to deal with. He's even once told me that ""It's okay"" because he ""doesn't understand personal space.""

What can I even do if he won't listen to me?

"For context, we both work in retail; she’s a cashier while I work a department floor. I can’t imagine this being an issue since we’re essentially at the same level in the store in terms of responsibility and leadership but advice on that would be nice.

"Throwaway account and first post, BUT please read cause I'm desperate! 

Background: Currently in a relationship with SO, we are on and off long distance due to me being in college out of state. We have been together for 2 years.

Now for the problem: So things are usually great when we are physically together. Of course I feel like that is normal, but when we are apart things aren't the best. I am a person who is very connected with my emotions and likes to know what is going on in the lives of people I care about so that I can be there for them in any way I can be. 

So my partner struggles with emotions and explaining them. SO has depression and has had suicidal thoughts before. Therefore, I am generally more worried and even more interested in SO's feelings/emotions. 

I feel like a partner should be someone you want to tell everything to, kind of like a best friend. SO though doesn't share even the simplest things in daily life often, but rarely shares emotions. This is quite difficult for me knowing that SO has some mental health struggles and lives in a difficult home situation.

Anyways, when I notice a sudden change in behavior or attitude I obviously know something is up and begin to worry especially because SO hasn't shared their feelings. Therefore, if it goes on for more than a few hours or just gets really bad (begins to take it out on me) I ask what's wrong. 9 times out of 10 I get ""I'm fine"" or ""nothing"". There is obviously something, SO just isn't opening up. I can be a little pushy, but I feel as if I have to pull it out of SO because SO would never tell me if I didn't. 

SO says they would share if I wouldn't be so pushy, but I highly doubt this based on previous experiences trying this. They also say that I have too high of expectations and shouldn't be so emotional and into feelings, because they are ""dumb"". 

Am I being too pushy? Do I have too high of expectations? Or should SO be more willing to share? 

I just honestly feel so emotionally disconnected from them because I rarely know how they feel. It's always a guessing game or pulling it out after continuing to inquire. I obviously care about SO and how they feel, but it doesn't seem reciprocated nor do I ever know how they feel. HELP! 

TDLR; SO doesn't seem to have emotions or at least doesn't want to share with me of all people. SO and I do have some communication issues in general and SO grew up in a house where real communication severely lacked.",relationships
"My boyfriend never wants to have sex with me.

So me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been dating for over a year and he seriously never wants to have sex with me. I will admit that I tend to have a pretty high sex drive so I’ve tried to be understanding, I really have. This is new territory for me because I honestly have never been in a relationship with someone who wasn’t ecstatic to have sex as much as I would let them. 

And with this relationship it didn’t start out like this, when we first started dating I was on an anti-depressant that caused me to have no sex drive and he was the one that always wanted to have sex. Most of the time I wasn’t in the mood, but I usually had sex with him anyways because it’s not that big of a deal and I like making my boyfriend happy. But at some point he just stopped wanting to have sex with me. I thought maybe it was just a phase and tried not to take it personally. But it’s been going on for months now and it’s actually getting worse. Every time I try to have sex with him he just says “no I’m not in the mood” or “I just don’t feel like it” and I always say “but you never want to” and then he says “yes I do”. But he doesn’t. The only times that we have had sex for the last several months has been because I initiate it, and he usually says no at first and I’ll say please and kiss on him and then he says okay. But then it kinda feels like I’m just forcing him to do it and I don’t like that. I’ve tried talking to him about it. Before he’s told me that he has always been like this and he just doesn’t have much of a sex drive. But again when we first got together he wanted it all the time. Last time I tried to talk to him about it he said it’s because we have a dog now. Or he just denies it when I say he never wants to have sex with me he says “yes I do” which just isn’t true. 

At this point, it’s really starting to get to me. I feel like he doesn’t find me attractive, that he doesn’t enjoy sex with me, I feel like I’m inadequate. I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Am I wrong for wanting to have sex more than once a month or once every 3 weeks? I’m not asking for it every day just maybe like once a week or once every two weeks even. It’s gotten to the point now that I don’t even try to have sex with him because it really hurts my feelings every time he says no. But who knows how long it’ll be before he tries to have sex with me. This could go on for months. And we’re just completely lacking intimacy all together. We live together and we barely touch, rarely kiss, I maybe get a hug once every two weeks maybe. I don’t know how to not take it personally and I don’t know what to do. 

I also want to add that I’ve been in long term relationships before. I was with my daughter’s father for over three years and we had a baby and we still had sex way more than this. I’d really appreciate any and all advice because I want to make this work but I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR Me (27F) and my boyfriend (29M) have been dating for over a year and for awhile now he just does not have any interest in having sex with me. I’ve tried not taking it personally but at this point it’s really getting to my head. I’ve never had this issue in a relationship and I don’t know what to do.",relationships
"My parents have always had a good peaceful relationship. Or at least , everyone has always thought so. My mom is a caring calm person, you know... that kind of person that never looks for trouble and is, sadly a bit easy to fool. She's just never suspicious about anything. 

My dad seems like a loyal husband , not really abusive, he just does everything to satisfy his family. It's an introvert, that has few friends at work and spends most of his time at home when he's not working. 
He's the kind of person to drag a lot tho, talks A LOT about how good he is, how smart, how handsome he was at his twenties and even about how many pretty girlfriends he had ( obviously) before mariage. He does so in mom's presence and just does'nt care.
Another things, when some romance stuff is on tv he likes to add how nice love is, how the flirting (first phase in a relationship) is the best part...

I mean, these are not red flags, right. If it was only that I would not suspect anything. 

But...

Nobody can ever touch his phone, not even mom. He regularly checks mom's phone tho.


He sleeps super late, way after mom is asleep, every single night. While she is sleeping in the bedroom he just sits in the living room, with his computer and my earphones, and with the door closed. He gets clearly deffensive when me or my sister step in the room , so it's like an unwritten rule not to disturb him. 

He has a  secret social media account. A facebook account. All the familly me included have facebook accounts and have sent each others friend requests . Not him, we know nothing about his account. Note that I know that he has one because he clearly said it himself. 

As I said he has a secret facebook account, he might claim it's just for news and stuff. But I am sure I accidently saw conversations on his phone more than once per accident. With long messages. I don't think it's just friends because :
One, he wouldn't hide it then
Two, as I said he has few friends, rarely talks to then when he's at home, if so he calls them directly and it's most of the time about work.

The alone in the living room part, I have suspected it was because he was watching non family friendly stuff. I know he is pretty addicted to those things. I (accidently, again) found out while browsing my own history browser and finding things I never searched before. Turns out we had the same email address, and it made me able to see his device s search history. 

I also accidently saw a video named something like "" my husband is addicted to non family friendly stuff "" in my mom s search history (ACCIDENTLY) when she (not familiar with technology) told me to delete her search history. Probably so he does'nt see it.


Things got serious when...

Not long ago , at night, only mom was asleep and my dad was in the living room with the door closed, I went to the bathroom next to the living room. I was staring at the mirror or something, not making any noise, when I heard a whispering. My dad was whispering to someone, and it suddenly came to me. He was probably chatting with someone with the computer, earphones on. Suddenly the sound just stopped, he went out of the room , came my way, said stuff like "" hey wyd"" as if he was checking who was there. He went back straight to the living room, and I could'nt hear anything anymore. 

I was sure I heard something that night. The next day, I had a plan. I wanted proof, a voice recording was the first thing  thought of. But he spends  nearly the hole night in there , and rarely goes out. I must put my tablet when he goes out of the room. And I did so, took it back when he fell asleep.

I found myself with an 8 hours long very low quality recording where I could not even jear my own voice. Mission failed . I just gave up, thinking I was probably imaginaging stuff. But today... I swear I heard the whispering again. And I am sure he is cheating. I just need material proof. I don't know what I'll do with it, but I need it.


tl;dr: I always  my dad was hiding something, but I never knew what. But I've found enough proof that he 's cheating. Not material proof tho, but how can I get some ?

I don't even know what to ask ,  any advice ?

"I've (20F) a bad relationship with my neighbour (40M), he is really demanding of how I should live in my apartment during the night, because of the noises I make. He is bothered by me dancing (my footsteps, no loud music) and showering, so now I have to be quite after 9pm all days (from monday to sunday).

PROBLEM is that he keeps complaining and comes at my door without even wearing a protective masks with a new reason to criticize me. Okay that I told him to tell me if I'm being noisy, but he is too excessive (6 times he came to complain) and changes story (before it was on the working days, then it was saturday and sundays). I had past neighbour complaining but like two times and we found an agreement. With this neighbour it looks impossible find a way to please him, he is too restrictive (9pm!?!) and unfortunately there's no timelines or apartment rules where I live (landlord doesn't want to and tenants don't care). 

Now I clearly have a difficult relationship with him, but since we live in the same apartment complex we have to ""get on well"" anyway, but he is the one dictating the rules. I get it, my footsteps noises are frustrating, he says I should understand at my age, ""but I don't"" and I could go outside since there's enough space. He should be more understanding (he THINKS he is with me), everybody lives their own way in their homes!
What do I do? 

TL;DR neighbour keeps showing up at my door complaining about noises and doesn't matter if we had an agreement before, he's always ready to complain about a new thing. I don't know what to do anymore.",relationships
"Hi,

So awhile back I (23 F) went through a relationship that was one of those “we’re dating and it’s exclusive but we don’t have a label” type things. This went on for 7 months. Once things started to get more serious and I was really developing feelings for him (26 M) (and he was too, as we had talked about how we felt about one another) he freaked out because he knew he’d have to deal with his last year of grad school and possibly having to move for an internship. He had this odd conversation with me about where it was going and then basically ghosted me less than a week before Christmas. 
I’ve worked through it and had a couple tough months but made it out.
My question is, since then, I haven’t been able to have any romantic or “catching feels” type feelings. At all, where I used to really be that way. I also used to want a relationship or be open to it and now even the thought of going on a date makes me feel claustrophobic and uninterested.
Any tips, insights, etc?
I’m pretty in tune with myself normally but this just feels like a blank brick wall and I need some advice.


tl;dr: past relationship bad, now I can’t feel

EDIT: it’s been 6 months since it ended",relationships
"I wish I could turn back time to when I had no worries in life and when my mother was here. My grandparents had inherited diseases and my mother passed away from the same. I grew up with no father and things were tough with me basically javing to raise myself and having to help my mother in poverty until we pulled out of that.

I grew up around drugs and violence and I have essentially lost almost all of my family (some lost to drugs, some gunned down, some took their own lives). My ex girlfriend also slipped up and cheated on me once and we broke up weeks ago. I am so frustrated and I don’t know what to do anymore. We went through all the shit just for her to not see me succeed how she wanted me to. 

I got into university and tried to walk in a straight path unlike my family, but I don’t think I could keep moving forward. I try my best to clear my mind. I take my motorcycle out for rides alone in the hills and through the country roads to clear my head, but nothing really makes me feel at peace.

I try to medicate with some drugs to calm me down now since I have trouble sleeping at all and I have tried eating and doing basic things, but I just want to stay where I am and I can’t come back from this. I just feel like I am essentially a robot now with no emotion. Then my ex came to my place because I couldn’t pick up her calls. She knows eveythimg about my life and she knows my situation.

She was the inly one who understood me and I love her. What she did hurts, but a part of me wants her back. She brought me food and she asked me if I would let her be here for me. I don’t know what to do. I am hurt by what she had done, but I also love her and I am windering if maybe the pros of havung her around outweigh the cons? Should I try and fix my relationship with her?

Tldr: my ex girlfriend who cheated reached out to me and she said she wants to be here and support me while I get better. She also asked if maybe we could get back together. I love her, but I am lost in how to move forward with life",relationships
"Hi Reddit! I [25F] have been dating my boyfriend [28M] for about a year now. We absolutely love each other and overall have a pretty good relationship. To get to the point, my boyfriend has been complaining that our relationship no longer is playful and that we are too serious all the time. I feel like he is insensitive sometimes with his jokes and I don’t always enjoy them. Here’s a very basic snapshot of the two of us:

Me [25F]: very sensitive, I’m vocal about what bothers me, good sense of humor (according to partner), can be anxious sometimes

My boyfriend [28M]: kindhearted, harsh with his words, critical, good listener

He’s been getting frustrated that our relationship isn’t so playful anymore. I explained that in the past, we only knew each other on a surface level and that nothing in between us was deep, so we joked around a lot more.  He says that I’m too serious about things now. I’m afraid it’s that he does/says certain things that are just not funny to me and he gets frustrated that I don’t find his gestures funny. Here are some examples:

1. He recently sent me a “funny” video about something I don’t find funny. I had explained to him in the past that that topic was not a joking matter to me due to past trauma I’ve experienced. After he sent the video, I got upset at him for expecting me to laugh at the very thing I told him I was traumatized about. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt by assuming he could have forgotten, but it was something I was very vocal about. He was very frustrated, and even told me that we should laugh at the things that make us uncomfortable so we can “face the pain.” He ended up apologizing after I explained it was insensitive of him. 

2. I was in the middle of doing something when he wanted to call me. We were texting. He told me that he really wanted to talk to me bc he missed me. I told him I couldn’t talk right then and there bc I was in the middle of doing something. He then told me a white lie to “encourage” me to call him as soon as possible. Mind you, I would call him ASAP regardless. So I finished up the task on hand and called him all excited about the white lie, and I was super pissed after I found out it was a lie and that he basically manipulated me to call him ASAP. I confronted him and told him that I would have called him either way and that the lie was unnecessary. He got upset bc he thought he was being cute and playful. Meanwhile I was livid bc I felt deceived. It wasn’t a big lie at all, but I’ve previously explained that the concept of truthfulness is huge for me. He doesn’t usually lie, so this caught me off guard. I feel bad for not laughing at or enjoying the gestures he does with a good intention. Is there something I’m not seeing?

A. Am I overreacting or being too sensitive? 
B. Is this a demonstration that my boyfriend’s sense of humor is lacking (I’m thinking this is the case)? He gets upset that I don’t find his gestures funny and that what he intends to make me laugh ends up hurting me. 
C. How can I “fix” this problem? I can’t just laugh at things I don’t find funny. He had previously told me he wanted to be more playful. I’m trying to work with him, but I don’t know how to go about it. 

TL;DR - my [25F] boyfriend [28M] gets upset that I don’t find his gestures/jokes funny. I can’t help but feel triggered about some of the things he brings up when he thinks he’s being funny/playful. I truly care about him. How do I go about making him feel validated?",relationships
"Sorry for the text wall! 

Tldr : Ldr BF (34M) of 18months is ""missing"" again. I'm sad and in dilemma now. Part of me knew that this is not going to work for long term, but part of me wonder what if he really has serious issue to deal with and I break up with him now could have further jeopardize his mental health. 
I'm lost. What should I do now? 



We were living together for the first half of the relationship then he accepted a better job offer in UK yet the job offer blew off last minute, he left with no choice but to go back to his home country with his parents. 

**The first** withdrawal (he will not answer my calls or reply any text) happened when the UK job offer blew off, he didn't tell me anything and just disappeared. I imagined all the worst scenario, repeatedly thought that it must be me who said or did something wrong. I was extremely devastated and cried all the time. I even hide in my office toilet to cry during working hours too. Then one day he just contacted me again and told me about what happened included his mental health problems that diagnosed by a professional (yet he refused and never go through any proper therapy).

After a while he found another job 12hours from home. He told me that it was something he always wish to work on, I can sense how excited he was and I'm really happy for him. Things were good. Then I can see he's not happy again. I heard he talked about long hours and the salary/benefits are the same with what agreed. **Second** withdrawal happened. I was devastated too, but given with the past experience, I didn't think that he's leaving me, but I was really worried about is he alright. And he turned up again.

So basically he tends to hide in his man cave when he's not happy. I know man react to problems differently, so I talked to  him and said please just let me know if he needs any space instead of just disappear. He agreed. Then there's **3rd** time where he did let me know. 

The **4th time** he did it again. It was for more than a week. I always keep in touch with his family. So this time, I reached out to his family and his family couldnt contact him either. One day, he just turn up in front of his parents' house with all his luggage and said he has quit his job but nothing more. None of us actually know what happened.

Since I was supposed to visit him in April. He has decided only look for a new job after my trip.
Yet, the trip is gone due to pandemic. The trip meant so much for us as we have not seen each others for so long, besides of money there are so many plans and hopes we had for this trip. 

The pandemic and lockdown is not easy for us too. He's worried about getting a job and I'm constantly worry that I will lose my job. 
I'm living alone,all on my own during this lockdown, his message pop up on my screen is the only thing that makes me happy.

Just last week, he did it again for the **5th time**. I have not sure why he can always said he loves me the day before and then just disappeared while he knew that's going to make me sad and worried.

Maybe practices do make perfect. I'm still sad but not like the last few times. I cried some times when something remind me of him and our broken dreams.

For the past week, I sent him total 3 text messages. 
Good Morning 
Another 1 is just to check whether he has recieved the surprise gift I ordered for him before he disappeared.
To ask is he alright, and I'm here if he needs. 

I know he might be struggling with his own problems now and his mental health could be worst during this global crisis.
Yet, what he did is deteriorating my mental health too. 
The dreams we used to have, shattered too. I can't see us living at the countryside adopt animals from the shelters and having our own kids. 

I'm hurt. I'm tired. 

Does it make sense to send him a break up text as he wouldn't even care or if he does, will it push him to the edge and hurt himself? 

Or is it better for me just do nothing and move along?",relationships
"I dont know where to start it's a throwaway account for sure just want other people thoughts of this.Im a guy in his early twenties and have never had a successful relationship.I would always fuck it up somehow or shit wouldn't work because I'm to sensitive and to eager to get into a relationship. I would genuinely see the good in everyone and not see their flaws not in an obsession way just like a hey your beautiful and I wanna get to know you way to early. Well let's just say I dated girls in the past and I see that their married with kids and their happy. I see some of them have graduated college and are just in a better place in thier life.I think to myself fuck if every girl does so much better without me,did I held them back in a way? I think to myself fuck I wished I gone to college as soon I got out of high school and not wasted time working and doing nothing.I dont know it sucks to think I wasted my time and did nothing for so long until last year.I went back to college last year and started working on getting my shit together.I was working two jobs and going to school full time was involved in my campus and just improving myself.I was doing fine until I fucked up
 again and fell down the same rabbit hole I put someone on a pedestal and I made the same mistake I did when I was younger.I hated myself for so long because of that shit I thought I learned my lesson but i didn't.I dont know why I do that to myself instead of being happy about everything I accomplished buying my first car ,passing all my class with A's,meeting new people,finding new jobs I actually like to work,moving out soon and improving myself.I only see the  negative side of this whole shit I dont know if I being to dramatic or not. I just wish shit was different that I could learn to handle myself better and not come off to strong at times.Is it weird to think that I am missing out In life because I see girls I used to date have thier life together and I'm barely starting to figure things out??i dont know anymore thanks is for reading.

"Hello fellow redditors, i came in search of words of wisdom.

Here is the deal. i've met my fiancé when i was 17, i've never really had any serious relationship before her. We are set to marry in september this year, and i'm not sure that she is the woman i want to have on my side to the rest of my days, How did you redditors knew your wife was the one ?

I'm a serious mess, my father and mother are divorced, and my father always vent out the fact that my mom cheated on him with me when was 9yro, and i think that left a scar. 

To top that i once had the biggest crush on a girl, the hardest i ever fell for someone. We weren't really dating, but one day, out of the blue she broke up with me. Later I found out she did because she was with other guy, and she chose him over me. I've loved her so much, I can't even describe, knowing that she was with other, and that she never really said nothing before we making out, or even why she broke with me. That was like a knife to the scar turning it into a open wound i don't know it's closed yet.

After that I begun to attend a management school and met my fiancée there we spent a year working together in a project and talking a lot on facebook, before we started dating (i need to add that i didn't even make out with here when we started dating).

Then we start to date and a lot of things happen, in the first 2 years we broke 10 times or more, but we always end up being together again. She is an amazing person, she is funny, she is beautiful and the most important part she is completely supportive, i've been through 3 deep depressions, one in which i ate so much that that i end up weighing 140 kg (308 pounds) from 80 kg (176 pound) in 6 months and she stayed with me all this time and support me. I feel so secure with her, i feel i can trust her and that she won't cheat on me.

But the thing is i don't think i really love here, i feel like being with her is ""comfortable"" and that it's really uncomfortable even to admit, i've never really felt like i love her, not even remotely close to feel the way i felt for the other girl, like my heart never really beaten any faster, nor anything.

Or ideas of future doesn't match, she want to stay put and have children. i want to travel the world and live in a different country. i Rather live in a RV cruising the continent while she want a nice house with lots of good things on it. She loves her family and i doubt she could not be apart from them for more than a month. Whereas i think i wouldn't feel bad if i don't see my in 10 years or more. I feel like i'm with her just cause i feel secure, just because i'm afraid of being cheated, just cause i can count on her to be on my side. But isn't this just the base of a relationship ? shouldn't we be with other for other motives ? i'm really afraid i'm missing out on life, just because we've been a long time together and i feel comfortable and secure.

Oh yea, and we don't live together yet, her parents won't allow we live together until we are married.

Help me fellow redditors, is she the one ? is this fear of missing out just some Bullshit ? Is she the right one ? how did you knew your fiancée/wife was the right one ?

 \*\*TL;DR\*\*: I'm a mess really insecure with cheating because parents divorce and past relationship. found a girl that is supportive and that i feel that won't ever cheat on me. But we don't have much in common nor have the same idea for the future, i don't feel like i love her, i just feel sooo comfortable and secure with her on my side, and i'm afraid i'm marrying for the wrong reasons and she's not the one i should marry.",relationships
"I love her, sweet, kind, together for 3 yrs. Her goal is to focus on future family because it's something she saw with her parents/stay-at-home mom, thinks the guy should be the provider. (she does not want kids for a few years, wants to spend time together first)  She does not want to feel like she ever has to work, except possibly for fun if she wishes. ( she's with her family since graduating college.) More old-school/traditional than me. I don't mind, and like that down the road she'll want to nurture the kids. But I'm only making $65k now out of grad school. I do have a lot of earning potential down the road (x3-4 my current salary) but it'll take a few years, especially in this economy. Wish she'd help out in the beginning by working but she does not want to. She wants me to step up and shift fields a little and prioritize getting a high paying job over my current trajectory which would take longer but is also my passion job, says that's a luxury to focus on passion and it's more important to prioritize security for family. Not sure what to do.

"Hello,

I recently lost the love of my life who decided his feelings had changed for me.

We had a disagreement because he was angry that I went to his mom for advice about our relationship-which I didn’t. I sought out her advice on stress management.

Anyways-he said he lost feelings for me and was no longer she he was 100% ready to commit to a serious relationship.

This argument lasted less than a day-and I promptly blocked him on social media instead of becoming needy or clingy.

What do you think the chances are that he regrets what he did and comes back since I made it pretty much a clean breakup and went No Contact almost immediately?

TL;DR my boyfriend broke up with me because he lost feelings",relationships
"hi, everyone. so, story time:

i dated this girl about 2 months ago but she still wanted to maintain contact and told me that she still wanted to ‘try things out’ but needed time. honestly, i had this feeling that I needed her. I’m only realizing this now but at the time I felt like I *needed* her. so that’s why I still constantly think about her. we only recently (about a week ago) stopped talking everyday. 

about our relationship: we had been talking on and off for a few years. when we met (freshman year of hs) we tried things out but she ended up breaking it up with me and got with someone else the next day (I know, bit of a red flag). she was with him for around two years. during the first few months, though, I told her a few times that I was into her but nothing would happen. sometimes she’d tell me she would break up with him to be with me but nothing ended up happening. so, i moved on with my life. this year, though, we got back to talking everyday because she broke up with him after he cheated on her. 

it was kind of clear she had some sort of feelings for me. I mentioned someone I had a crush on and she reacted weirdly. so, i asked her what was up. she said she wanted to be with me. 

knowing how things had gone two years ago, I was hesitant. but i wanted to respect her feelings so I told her we should be together. we went like this for a few weeks when she told me about how her ex had texted her sister, saying he regretted everything and wanted to talk to her. we laughed it off and she said she’d never talk to him again. a few nights later, she texts me that he wants to hang out with her (this is like 11 at night). I ask her to please not go, but she goes. the next morning i asked her what happened. she was being pretty secretive but ended up telling me they kissed. I was very angry and just ended up things with her. after a while we got back to talking and, as I mentioned previously, we talked until fairly recently.

I just don’t understand how she could do that. I was there for her when she needed someone, I cut off any possibilities with the crush I had at the time for her, and I respected her feelings. 

I know ‘being nice’ doesn’t make me entitled to things working out, but it’s still so messed up to me. 

we would talk about sexual things (she was the only person I have ever talked about this kind of stuff with, we’re both 17), we talked about meeting each other’s families, and so much more. 

again, I know this doesn’t necessarily mean anything but, still, why did she do that? and, to make things worse, she still hung out with him afterwards. I asked her why and she just said ‘he is fun’. she herself told me it was a toxic relationship so I just don’t understand the why. 

I want to text her about that. I really don’t know what my objective is. maybe to let her know I’m angry, maybe to let her know what she did wrong. I don’t know. I know texting her isn’t the best thing but I don’t know what to do anymore. sorry for the long post. 

i miss her.

TL;DR: i was in a relationship a few months ago and she cheated on me and I want to ‘angry text’ her about it. I don’t know what my objective is. what should I do?",relationships
"Now look, I get that I’m quite young and I always get the excuse “But you’re young you have plenty of time”. But the pain does stay with me, the regrets and the what ifs, the fact I will pin the blame on me because it takes the pain from someone else, especially if I’m with someone. 

I’ve come to learn over time that I haven’t been haven’t been happy since my relationship with a girl that I would’ve genuinely considered perfect. This wasn’t the most recent girlfriend either by the way, this was 3 years ago.

Sure we used to argue but over time I’ve also learned that everyone argues, but people that stay together push through it together and we always did. But my stupidity and blindness to it caused the end and I have never let that go. 

People say you have to find happiness with yourself but before her i was happy with myself, when I was with her I was happy with myself and with her. After it ended though it never felt the same. 

I guess I carry the guilt of making a mistake because she wanted to get back together because she missed me and I fully regret not saying yes. I said no at the time because I saw how unhappy she was with the arguments and I would rather give it up and see her happy with someone else then give me mine.

I have matured a bit since then due to events in my life, but every time I look back I never think “I made the right choice” because I did make her happy and she made me happy. I just let my guilt take the better of me instead of seeing the real picture. 

I struggle now with finding people, struggle with talking to people because she understood me to a T. I know it’s pathetic to hold onto guilt like that but it’s something that doesn’t leave and my failure didn’t just make me learn but it haunts me.

TL;DR: I made a mistake that has stuck with me for years and i can’t get away from it no matter how hard I try.

"Me(18F) and this guy (20M) met online and started talking since last 5 months. We eventually got romantic and confessed but we were not ready for LDR so we decided to remain mutually exclusive but not give labels to each other. Fast forward, we had a huge fight 10 days back and that led to him saying he can't do this anymore,it stresses him out and he wants us to talk less ( talk less as in not talk at all other than if I need help). He also said ""I love you,i know it's easier for u to think I don't but I do, however I can't do this"". That was the first time he said *I love you*. 

Later that evening I texted him how I can't do this and I would be okay if we go back to being friends and taking things slowly but he turned cold and told me he doubts if I'll be able to do it and dismissed me. I gave him an option to text me back if he wants to remain friends. 
Next day I sent him meme and he sent cloud pics like we always did and left me on read.
I texted him later after around 4 days ""hey how's it going?"" And we started *small talks* since then but I'm always the one to text first and initiate. He replies but never initiates and have been constantly leaving me on read. I asked him if I should just take hints and not text anymore but he said he was just watching some videos. I texted him next morning that it's okay and then he replied to my previous unanswered questions like he used to when we were *together* 

He only shares stuff we used to talk about or stuff I like when I initiate conversation and leaves me on read or cuts it short.

I had enough and thought I won't text back. All my texts are answerable but idk why he's being so cold.

I don't know how to go about this situation. Should I give up? Should I ask him directly? What is it? Should I give him some space? Help me !

"My boyfriend (M22) of one year (during college) and I (F21) broke up when I went home because he doesn’t want to do long distance once we start our jobs. Although I took time getting used to this idea, I think it’s a good thing as we are both still young and want to experience new things and people. We have talked about remaining friends, so i’m wondering what the best way to go about this is. 

Some of my friends say the only way to remain friends is to cut off all communication (how long?) to allow ourselves to fully “get over each other/move on.” As far as I can tell there is no motive on either side to get back together, and with lockdown (we wont immediately feel jealous of anything because we are both stuck inside), I feel this isn’t necessary. Does anyone have any experience with this? Our communication would include occasional texting and probably rarer facetimes. 

Thank you!

TL;DR Will continuing to communicate with ex lead to problems down the line as we try to remain friends or can this be done successfully?",relationships
"Hey. So guys- I'm in a 2 year relationship. We moved in almost immediately together because it fit so well.


I thought everything was kind off going fine until yesterday. He tried to ask me for sex two days in a row but I didnt feel it because the act of asking me directly is a huge turnoff to me when I'm not in the mood yet. Maybe that's stupid. 
 Thats why yesterday I decided to try to initiate. The problem? I normally try it more subtle... by kissing, making out.  But it never ever ever works. Not once in all this time. That's my fault probably, I know. Well nevertheless I tried to do it more his ""way"". We were sitting on the bed and I asked him if he would like to have sex. He didnt really reply and that was it. 

A few minutes forward and I lay next to him and ask him what was going on. He said it sucked what I was trying to do. Because I didnt follow up on the question. Well, because Ibwas waiting for consent. That's what I do if he asks me.

And then it all started. He told me how  unsatisfied he is. That he doesnt wanna ask for sex because it feels like he gets turned down anyway. That he wants me to be more dominant and aggressive about getting sex. In itself all reasonable I guess.
The problem is, which I told him several times already, that I dont feel like I have the skills for that. Everytime I tried to kinda go there he didnt get it or ignored me. I know I'm passive when it comes to sex and I genuinely tried to change it more. I told him honestly that it comes from tons of sexual trauma with my ex. It hurt to talk about it and I broke down completely, sobbing. 

The thing is that I just dont understand how all of it escalated that much. He never communicates properly. All the stuff he said I had to work an hour for. He barely talked, just a few unemotional sentences. I just feel so bad right now.
I tried to explain to him that I get why he would be uncomfortable asking but I, even thought he didnt realize I tried to initiate, tried to get sex dozent of times and never got it. I feel so frustrated how little he tried to understand me. I tried to also understand that I get he has his preferences and I will try to initiate that way... but it's just not good enough because I dont feel turned on by asking directly. 

I just feel sooo disappointed.  I thought he was a ""good guy"". We can spend 24/7 together and are fine. We are always together. He is my best friend. But now I feel intensely judged and uncomfortable. I feel like my tries to communicate (I'm on the lower end of the spectrum and really try to communicate well because of that) are always met with one sentence factual answers. 


Finally- maybe you'll guys suggest breaking up. I understand that sentiment but please also understand how hard it is for me. He is my second relationship. My first was really really bad. We fit like best friends. I had him for 2 years almost everyday. I'm just... confused.

Also: I know I need therapy. I'm already looking for a good therapist. 

Thanks for your help.

TL;DR : Cant initiate sex with bf because he doesnt see it as initiating, communicating with him fails completely.",relationships
"I’ll keep this short. My bf and I are in our early 20s, have been together for a year and a half, living together for a year. We have every intention of building a life together, getting married, all that jazz.

Here’s the issue. I get upset about stuff like any other person and I cry when I get upset like any other person. And when I get upset and cry, I usually like to rant and have someone listen to me. But I hate telling my boyfriend about my problems because of the way he reacts and he hates it when I don’t tell him about my problems. So I tell him. And it always ends the same: with him telling me I’m stupid, fucked up, or that it’s my fault and proceeding to yell at me (why does he think this is helpful) and tell me that what I’m experiencing is invalid, that my feelings are invalid. I’ve told him that what he does doesn’t help me and that the best thing he can do for me when I rant about my problems is either distract me by talking to me about something else or just not say anything and hug me. He says that my way won’t work and that he will not have me “go down a rabbit hole” because he didn’t say anything. I go down a rabbit hole because he opens his mouth and says shit like “you’re stupid and fucked up”. It makes me feel worse than I already did. I don’t think he has the right to tell me what’s best for me because I know that for myself.

We don’t agree on this because I think his methods are ineffective. He even says he can’t deal with me and that he doesn’t know what to do. But I always tell him that the best thing he can do for me is just to hug me and listen to me talk. Buuuut he refuses to do that because he thinks it won’t work. He hasn’t even tried. And every time we talk about this, he just tells me that I’m wrong and don’t know shit. Am I?

TL;DR: I get upset sometimes about random shit. My bf always wants me to talk to him about it but doesn’t react well. We’ve talked about it. I gave him a solution that will work FOR SURE. He won’t try it and just tells me that I’m wrong. Am I?",relationships

Before we were laid off, the manager (30s) continued to make advances despite me not reciprocating/knowing I am in a relationship and I feel it is an unfair and inappropriate situation due to him being my boss. He:

\-has asked me to stay late to do extra work but now I see it just for us to hang out

\-has made unprovoked sexual comments

\-told me he put my name in his phone as a pet name which threw me off guard. Wasn't a name I've ever been called, it was just something he decided to put in his phone because he thought it suited me

\-has been near tears pouring his heart out to me and I feel very uncomfortable by this because I don't know how to respond, and he demands a response

\-he'll acknowledge I'm in a relationship, but it's like he thinks if he keeps trying I will realize I should leave my partner for him (which I will not do).

I feel like I have been direct enough with him and I cannot be any more direct since he is my boss/controls the scheduling/all connection I have to my job. I just want to make my money and I don't want to be friends with him or even any of my coworkers anymore.

He asked this week if I wanted to come work some limited hours. I told him I wouldn't be able to work there for now bc I need to continue to social distance (i also still work a full time job remotely that i was thankfully not laid off from). How do I get out of this situation? I feel like the only way out of this is to ghost him/not return to work once things are back to normal which I know is unprofessional but I am sick about the whole situation. I am mad that I let this happen. I also really need the money from this second job,.

TL;DR: manager was making me uncomfortable with advances and I don't know how to get out of returning back to work",relationships
"I have been with my GF for 3 1/2 years and have lived with her for a little over a year. 

Everything has been great until the recent pandemic. We are forced to stay at home in our state so I have been doing nothing but hang around with her. For the last few weeks, I have found myself getting sick of her. 

We have been fighting a lot more than usual. I just find myself getting irritated much easier and lashing out a bit at small and mundane things. 

Having sex isn't a want right now, it feels more like a chore. We recently went from once a week to once a month. 

I feel I'm getting close to the point where I either need to tie the knot or quit wasting my time. The thought of leaving her puts a knot in my stomach but it is clear I feel different right now than I did before. 

I wanted to see if what I'm going through is normal and other people have been experiencing it during quarantine time or if I may need to consider ending things.

Let me know if I need to give more information. Thank you!

"We’ve been together for 3 years. Recently he’s been acting suspicious (more time on his phone, quickly hides his screen, carries it on him everywhere) and putting out red flags. Basically classic signs of SOMETHING is going on. 

I straight up asked him to see his phone (I have never asked him before) and he refused adamantly. We were spending the day together. He then only let me see his phone a couple hours after he went “to the bathroom” and was in there for at least 15min. He handed me the phone but I gave it back. 

He obviously deleted some stuff while he was in the bathroom and I told him so. He accused me again of picking fights but I told him to take me home early. 

We’ve barley spoke since. Should I just break up with him and be done with it? I’ve been feeling paranoid and upset since then, but in the back of my mind what if he’s not doing anything and I’m ending a good relationship? 

I’ve caught him lying about stuff in the past (where he was at, and how late he is getting home but genuinely out with his friends). Am I overreacting?

TL;DR: Acting suspicious and wouldn’t let me see his phone. Now what?

EDIT: I appreciate all the comments and have read every single one. I will make an update tonight after we see each other (which will most likely result in a breakup..). Thank you to everyone commenting and sharing similar stories, my heart hurts for all of you who have been cheated on.",relationships
"TL;DR: Should I initiate our convo after we both kinda flaked on our first date and not texted for a week now?

I am 23, he is 27. We met on a dating app and texted for over a month. He asked me out **LAST MINUTE(!)** for like **10+** times but I was either too busy, too lazy or feeling ugly so I rejected them all. (I really prefer dates planned at least a day ahead rather than impromptu ones) He asked me to propose a date so I picked Saturday and he agreed. (P.S. I just got a soul-sucking job that required working 6 days/week so I took a Saturday leave for our ""first date"". He didn't know about my pathetic work schedule though. He only knew I got a new job.)

No text during the day on Friday so I assumed the date was off :'(

On **Friday 11pm**, he texted me asking me where I wanna go tmr, and I replied ""You decide :p"" and asked him when he was available. He said he was available **in the afternoon**. A few mins later, he asked me if I would like to go for **lunch** or **dinner**. (So I assumed he was available **BOTH** in the **afternoon** and at **night** right??)

I only have a sad lil weekly day-off so I planned to squeeze my social (distancing) activities in one day - meet my friend **in the afternoon** and meet him **in the evening**. I replied to him **THE NEXT DAY 10am**(*did I reply too late?*) that I am available at 6pm. An hour later he said he couldn't make it if it's tonight... so I replied ""Oh okay then...""

TBH I was pretty pissed because I took my leave **FOR HIM**. I thought he was available **BOTH** in the **afternoon** and at **night.** Did he suddenly have a date with an unknown girl?! :(

Later that night he asked me what I did today and I replied hanging out with friend and trying out a restaurant. I asked him back and he said he went to an island nearby with his high school friend. He sent me a photo of him putting his hands in his pockets (*okay he's pretty muscular*) at the beach with blue sky, the kind of photo that's pretty *Insta*. He asked me if the food was nice.

And here we go, I replied ""Really nice weather lol"" and ""Very yummy :p"" *(Did I make a mistake not complimenting him? I actually did. I whispered* ***so muscular*** *when I saw it... Though now thinking about it, I would also feel sad if I sent a guy my photo and he only commented on the background.)*

He only replied to my ""Very yummy"" message with a thumbs-up cute pug sticker **the next morning**, and THAT'S IT.

THAT'S IT.

He used to text me good morning and goodnight, asked me about my day EVERYDAY. He would double text me if I haven't replied for long. I expected he would text me later but no... NOTHING. So I really put up my A-game, 2 days later I replied to the sticker with ""So cute"". And...

He did not reply.

Now one week has passed, should I text him? It would really bruise my ego (even more) if he doesn't reply/reply unenthusiastically.

P.S. I am a relationship virgin as if you couldn't tell already.. I really thought we had a chance and I could finally get into a relationship like EVER.

UPDATE: I know not meeting up is the best during this time, but in my country the number of local cases is 0 for quite a number of days, and we both still have to go to work at office everyday so I think it is acceptable if we BOTH wear masks when we meet.",relationships
"My parents on the face of it are pretty cool but really they are old school Gujarati Indian parents. If I get a letter or parcel, they will open it or ask what it is (and not drop it). Or if I get a call I'll be questioned about who it is. Even on zoom calls with my friends or SO, I have to lie sometimes, otherwise I'll be asked why I'm always talking to my friends. And it has to planned because of this. 

My parents can't handle the idea that I could date someone who doesnt have the same background and I've had to lie about my relationship with my SO for a year now. It's put a lot of strain on us (more than I tell my SO) and obviously now with lockdown it's getting pretty bad.

I feel trapped but need realistic advice. I can't just tell my parents to give me space, or not open my post (I have tried that btw). In there anyone in a similar position who can help? 


I was supposed to move out but plans got paused due to covid but it's now straining all my relationships

Tl;dr my parents are putting strain on my other relationships  and I've run out of ideas to help",relationships
